A beautiful fashion. And. we are back live from the WWE world in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As WrestleMania weekend wraps up tonight in our raw after mania, which will be taking place from the arena here where the Philadelphia Flyers play and have never won a Stanley Cup in anybody's existing.

0 (43s):

1 (45s):
A pen here. I like that.

0 (47s):
In Philly. Wow.

1 (50s):
Okay. Did not expect to do a little hockey talk earlier. Hockey is awesome. The penguins are back in the damn thing. You should know that. But nonetheless it has been Sidney Crosby owns your entire city. I don't even know how to say this about the flyer. Good heat brother. I don't even know how to say it. Anyways,

2 (1m 6s):
I'm 12 points.

1 (1m 8s):
Let's, let's not talk about who likes what hockey team. Let's just talk about how amazing this weekend has been. Here in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, there has been so many moments and memories that'll be talked about forever. Here in the WWE including last night, the most dominant

0 (1m 26s):
Re

1 (1m 26s):
Of A WWE Universal Championship came to an end as Roman reigns lost. As we acknowledge one final time our travel team to the American nightmare, Cody Rhodes, who is now our WW champ, Cody Rhodes is on the show on Friday. He told a story about his bus starting on fire Friday night and that's how the weekend started. On Saturday, he lost to a people's elbow from the Rock. And then on Sunday, somehow he was able to persevere and survive with the help of amongst others the Undertaker and John Cena.

0 (2m 8s):
Yeah.

1 (2m 11s):
His a sign over there that said, I came from Chile to see John Cena. Well, good news. He'll be joining us at about one o'clock Eastern time. John Cena Fresh outta the Ricky Snicky movie. Yeah. That we all absolutely love. Cody Rhodes will be here. Ricky Snicky will be here. And awesome Truther. Now the Monday night raw tag team champions will be here in about 13 minutes. Lane Johnson will join us in a third hour, obviously. Super Bowl champion for the Philadelphia Eagles and a stud. Who is the big white Ludo alongside Jason Kelsey. Yep. On Saturday night. Today's show should be packed and stacked. There's obviously lot going on in college basketball, which turns me to the Toxic Table at Boston. Connors sweet shirt. Shout out to Hall of Fame. Haman.

1 (2m 51s):
Yeah.

2 (2m 51s):
Incredible run by him, him and Roman at the end. It was very emotional. It was cool to see them walking off and leaving whoever caught that from the crowd, shout out to them. 'cause that video was fantastic.

1 (2m 60s):
It was a nice hug. I assume the wise man was telling Roman, Hey, take this in one last time. Yeah. Yep. You deserve this. Speaking of you deserve this at Ty Schmidt, Iowa Hawkeyes, get their ass beat by South Carolina. Well, in the national championship now it was 12 points or whatever the case is, And. it was obviously an electrifying start to that entire game. Inevitably what everybody feared could potentially happen to the Iowa Hawkeyes women's team did happen with the South Carolina team who's undefeated have not lost. And the total three losses that they've had. 109 and three or something ever. The last 112, it's been by a total of seven points. Those three losses. Jeez. To talk about dominance. This South Carolina is certainly that. Dawn Staley and the team are fantastic and this Iowa Hawkeys team that we have certainly come to love and enjoy And.

1 (3m 44s):
it has brought ratings that women's basketball has never seen Lou in another national championship tie as an Iowa Hawkeye. How do you feel about it and how pumped and thankful are you for the Iowa Hawkeys women's team given us something to really get zeed up about every March. Madness. Yeah.

3 (3m 58s):
I mean these last, well two years really have been incredible. Like what they've done just putting on for the state as a whole. Like we always talk, I mean anytime we're talking about Iowa, we're talking about Iowa football and how bad their offense is. How do these guys continue to win? So the women to come in here and then obviously someone like Caitlyn Clark to just kind of take over the entire world. We knew that yesterday. Like I mean if you have watched this at all, like we talked a little bit last week, the whole Iowa LSU thing, like that was Iowa's chip on their shoulder, a venge in last year's loss. They beat South Carolina. So like obviously they were coming into this game ready to go. They're just so big. They're so big and they're so deep. They're so deep. They, I think they outscored Iowa. They had 30 points, 37. Yeah, exactly. To nothing. It's just like So I mean.

3 (4m 40s):
I don't wanna say they ran outta gas, but it was one of those things where Kaitlyn Clark early You know she had what like 19 points in the first quarter was like, oh, okay, she might go for 50 and they might win. But then South Carolina did what they kind of done to everyone this year. They just put the screws to 'em a little bit more and ultimately it was just too much for them to overcome. But what they've done to not only for women's basketball but for the state of Iowa, like I have an immense amount of pride in that team.

1 (5m 4s):
Congratulations to South Carolina. Definitely earned it. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely earned it. Good. See one half of the hammer Don. One half of the hammer cowboys to digs is here now. Tone. We learned from a future guest of our show about 10 minutes from now. The. Miz that there are some people out there that actually think whenever we say one half of the hammer, Don, that that Don is supposed to be a sound that a hammer makes when it hits something. That was, that was The. Miz, The Miz said idiot. So whenever you say hammer and it's da like a sound, a hammer makes, he had no idea. That was eye-opening. But how about WrestleMania weekend for you all marked up with a mark shirt right now?

1 (5m 46s):
Yeah,

4 (5m 47s):
It was unbelievable the fact that I have the take shirt. No one ever expected take to come out like that. The Cena thing, maybe Cena was coming out, maybe that was gonna happen. But take when that hit. That was, that was the loudest I've ever heard a stadium in my life. I assume I, there's been a lot of big pops in the WWE that was had to be one of the biggest pops of all time. Like when the dong hit we, we lost our shit. And then obviously, I mean I knew, I knew it was Cody's time baby. It was always Cody's time. You guys, you you guys. The Romans the guy. Okay, it's Cody's time.

1 (6m 18s):
Fan.

0 (6m 20s):
Fan. Tony Cody Rose fan Whoa.

1 (6m 45s):
Yeah, it was electrifying. Yeah. His entrance last night was awesome.

4 (6m 48s):
Unbelievable. His entrance last night. There was a lot of really cool Seth Rollins entrance. Obviously Roman with the, the entire symphony was awesome. Sch warrior with all the Ks and the swords. It

1 (6m 58s):
Was awesome. It was absurd. There's those, oh there's Seth freaking Romans. Yep. With the mums Whoa.

4 (7m 4s):
Seth had a rough weekend. Whoa

0 (7m 7s):
Took

1 (7m 7s):
The chair last

4 (7m 8s):
Late. Teas in peace of that knee

0 (7m 10s):
There. Oh man.

1 (7m 13s):
Shiner.

0 (7m 13s):
Yeah. Bit of

4 (7m 14s):
Shiner.

1 (7m 15s):
Seth freaking Rollins obviously had a rough evening, a rough weekend. And inevitably because Roman ring saw his back in that shield vest. Yep. He couldn't help himself to take the eye off the ball. Yep. We don't see that from Roman much. Never. But he said this Seth Rollins son of a bitch had to hit him. Had to, that was in Indianapolis when Seth Rollins crazy ended the shield And. then we learned on documentary about a week and a half ago. Roman Rains never wanted to break up the shield. He was heartbroken by that. And this Seth freaking rollin guy comes out Echo Charlie whole thing. Yeah. And then comes crawling out. Takes eye off the ball. Cody gets the big time win. Congrats to Cody. Rhodes the American nightmare once again.

0 (7m 56s):
Very cool. Now two

1 (7m 58s):
Men that we are obviously incredibly lucky to get a chat with every single day. Both with superior NFL experience. Big brains also big marks now ladies and gentlemen. AJ Hawk there.

0 (8m 12s):
Yeah.

1 (8m 15s):
Debut. I'll start with you pal. Seemed like you were having a phenomenal WrestleMania weekend. Everybody seemed to be here. Yeah, everybody. I saw so many humans of notoriety here at WrestleMania. It felt like the whole world descended upon Philadelphia. Oh

5 (8m 28s):
Yeah. Bring a lot of great people together. Was some people that kind of pissed us off in the crowd early on. But we had a great, great show man. See what? See him punk getting in the mix. Obviously Damien Priest coming out. Cash in the money in the bank. That was, that was unbelievable. And then the best part of the night, obviously Cody finishing his story. Obviously You know you wanted Roman rains to continue his rain. But Cody finishing his story, it was dope to see that ending. So

1 (8m 52s):
Speaking of dope, two chain of smoking weed error.

6 (8m 55s):
I didn't see that. I don't know what I know what you're talking about. He was smoking I what you're talking about. Fantastic Little Pearl. I believe it was. It was talking about was the lights

1 (9m 2s):
Were out in the stadium. Yeah, it might, who knows who it was. Yeah. Who knows who it was.

6 (9m 6s):
Was it Snoop in there?

1 (9m 7s):
Seemed to be coming from that area. But I'm just sitting there and all of a sudden it's like I'm smoking with somebody right now. Oh

6 (9m 13s):
Yeah.

1 (9m 14s):
Oh no, I don't know who it is. And I look back and I'm like, I think I just smoked two chains. Right. And he didn't know that. Yeah, we didn't know that. But it was a great time.

4 (9m 22s):
And the writer of left hand app, who are we? The commanders was actually providing a little bit of defense from the security guard. Yeah,

1 (9m 28s):
I did see that. I did see there was a potential Wale mania happening with the security guard.

4 (9m 32s):
We asked him, Hey you wrote that song, right? He said, no, Pat lied. He made that all

6 (9m 36s):
Up. So not we. We did not ask that. Tony asked it and Wale was like, Hey you son him a bitch.

1 (9m 43s):
Put your left hand.

6 (9m 45s):
Are we welcome Commanders?

1 (9m 48s):
AJ Hawk. You were not here. You went home because you have 10 kids or whatever watched at home. Did you enjoy the hell outta the weekend aj? Yeah.

6 (9m 55s):
I mean, not surprising LA Night. It's a big win over AJ style. you know that right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry about, I think I called that one right. Coman ke our we, we did our picks on Friday. I'm, I'm obviously very confident I picked LA Night

1 (10m 11s):
To Win. Did you see who they gave that? And no offense to os. Okay. We love Os. We love

6 (10m 15s):
Of love the Os. Some of them,

1 (10m 17s):
Not all of them. A lot of os hate us. Oh

6 (10m 18s):
Yeah, I know what

1 (10m 18s):
You're, they gave that Slim Jim car. He came squealing in there. I was in the parking lot when he shot that So I. I come walking off said bus and then all of a sudden to my right I hear drinking cars squealing in. I'm like, holy shit, that thing's coming in pretty quick. I get out, it's actually LA Night. I'm like, no stunt drivers. No stunt drivers. That's what we're talking about. LA Night. Then I see 'em hand the keys over that car's never gonna hit that usage ever again. Yeah. Speed. I don't think now, unless that sweet old lady has got a lead foot, which she might a hundred percent sure. But that Slim Jim tie with him has been awesome. That was his first mania match. I mean

6 (10m 59s):
You talk about a budding superstar. We all know that. We've been saying that for a couple years now. But he's like Tom Cruise does his own stunts, does everything himself Whoa pretty much same level as Tom Cruise

1 (11m 7s):
Now tc. Okay. Let's talk's,

6 (11m 9s):
Talk about

1 (11m 9s):
Tonight's relax. Let's talk about tonight's big matchup. Purdue Zach. Edie makes his way to the national championship against the Dragons and Dan Hurley and Yukon and Cling Calm. Seven and a half point favorites are the reigning national championships. Who said rain and repeat has been our motto all year. Debut. As you watch these teams play throughout this tournament, throughout this season, what are your thoughts? Who do you like? And is Yukon beatable now I will say you Yukon people have been getting on microphones and popping off at the Moth. Yeah. They have too much and people have been taking it as it's journalism. Okay. Yeah. Diana Tara Rossi who won the Yukon is gonna say Paige is better than Kaitlyn Clark. She not only does she have to Yeah, right.

1 (11m 52s):
She kind of has to because you want the Yukon. Like that's so Molly's like. We'd be talking more about Paige like she want the Yukon. Remember everybody we see talking about some form of comes from this tiny little school, Yukon

5 (12m 6s):
George, Connecticut.

1 (12m 7s):
So whenever you give this answer, I would like everybody know this is a biased response, which is coming out a lot through the media being taken as like journalism. It's like, hey, we're all shit talking right now. This is good. Yeah. This is good for sports. Not bad for sports. We need this to happen more often. Yeah. Yes. With that being said, be a journalist real quick. Zach Edie's gonna go at Cling Kong all night. How do you see this one going? I mean

5 (12m 28s):
I'm, I am looking forward to the ballot of Bess, but we had Hurley on last week. And that defense man. That Yukon defense is smothering and I don't care if you're a fan of Yukon or not. If you've been betting on 'em, if you've been watching. Yeah, you are. They are a covering machine. They've been dominating. I think this opened up at five and a half already moved to seven and a half. But obviously Newton the point guard for us. His, his shots haven't really been falling, but still a playmaker. I'm excited about this one tonight. She'll be a blowout to your point. Yeah. I think 16 ties in the last 30 years between the men and women. So yeah, we're gonna talk our shit. Yeah.

1 (12m 57s):
As, and everybody's getting like upset about it. It's like, imagine if Diane Te Rossi said, yep, I'll take Kaitlyn Clark over Paige every single day. It'd be like Yukon. People would be like, oh yeah, well, oh, get the hell out of our family. Yeah. That ain't how this goes. This tournament though. Marks madness. Both the men's and the women's has lived up to the hype seemingly. Oh

2 (13m 14s):
Yeah. Yeah. It's been incredible. And debut kind of snuck in there. It's gonna be a blow tonight. I, I mean that's, it's hard to believe that. 'cause finally, like you said, we got Kling Kong, the seven two monster versus another seven four Ed So I. It feels as though this is where all roads led to now. Seven and a half points in a national championship game between two one seats. Yep. Like has that ever happened? Probably not because,

1 (13m 35s):
Well that's 'cause Dan Hurley's got that dumps in the dragon. Yeah.

2 (13m 38s):
Yeah. Which you, which you can respect of course. But Ed's been waiting for this moment and when you lose to a 16 seed the year before, usually, and I'm saying usually 'cause it's only happened one time before this, the year after Virginia won the Natty. So maybe everything is finally lining up for Purdue. Seven and

4 (13m 54s):
A half is a lot. And if your Yukon Yukon's been playing with their food a little bit in the first half, but they have been the, they might be the best basketball all basketball team of all time in second half. So maybe just do the second half line and just not even worry about it. Okay.

1 (14m 6s):
Smart. Take it home. Yeah. With the Yukon,

4 (14m 9s):
They've been unbelievable. Like 30 zero run in the second half NC State. They put away in the second half easily. Like that's just been how they've been. Has anyone

1 (14m 15s):
Given Purdue a chance? I am Hell. yeah. I

2 (14m 18s):
So

1 (14m 18s):
Am I. I tell seven foot five that on seven foot five he's got, what

2 (14m 22s):
If he scores 52 and everyone else plays Well

1 (14m 24s):
They win. Did you see what I did the last time? 50. I saw a seven foot five guy. What'd you do? I exited the royal rum.

0 (14m 29s):
Smart. That's right. Yeah.

1 (14m 30s):
Pretty smart.

5 (14m 31s):
Smart.

4 (14m 31s):
Literally self

2 (14m 32s):
Preservation.

1 (14m 33s):
Saw a seven foot five guy.

0 (14m 38s):
That's

1 (14m 39s):
Not just him. I got the hell

4 (14m 41s):
Out of it. Yeah. Not just him. The other guy that was in the ring just moved an entire ring this weekend. 'cause he runs 45 miles an hour

1 (14m 46s):
Off the ropes. Oh, you're talking about Bron brakes. Yeah.

2 (14m 48s):
Yeah. Big. So

1 (14m 50s):
He was also in a, he run at me a little bit. I was also reminded last night by one American nightmare that as I was getting into the Royal Rumble, we made eye contact for an uncomfortably long amount of time. He was in the match at that time. Yeah. And he was just staring at me from the Ring apron as I was walking up the steps. And I was like, is Cody Rhodes about to kick me In the face is Cody Rhodes about to kick my ass. And I look inside and there's a human that's bigger than you're supposed to be built. And I said, gimme that. I'm not supposed to be here. I got my, I got my snake skin boots on. Exactly. Get me the hell outta here. And I did that. But seven foot five can really do some special things. Speaking of special, here's a tag team that's been brought back in this year, 2024.

1 (15m 33s):
And the world has erupted because of it. Tim McAfee hasn't always been the biggest wrestling fan. I don't think he ever truly comprehended why I loved it so much as a child. But now that I'm in it, he's been paying attention to it. 'cause he's spoiled Dad. Of course.

0 (15m 49s):
Yeah. Good Pops.

1 (15m 50s):
One of these members of this tag team is his favorite human in entertainment. Wow. He's a rapper. Quiet, hilarious, quiet, entertaining, quiet confused why but electrifying And his tag team partner, his guy that I beat in WrestleMania like a minute 45. Right. Light work. Then he lost a Snoop Dogg and I think he was on like a like 175 match lost streak. Makes sense. And he finds his old tag team partner. They climbed a ladder now they're our tag team champions on Monday night.

1 (16m 32s):
Hell. yeah. Ladies and gentlemen run the truth. Killings and The Miz. Awesome. Truth. Yay.

0 (16m 57s):
What up?

1 (16m 59s):
What up?

0 (16m 60s):
What up?

1 (17m 11s):
Tim McAfee is losing his mind right now. Hey, You can get with this or You can get with that. Yeah. But you should get with this 'cause this is where it's at. What's up?

0 (17m 29s):
Yes.

1 (17m 29s):
Truth. What up man? What's up Pete? Hey, you're champion.

Just like being here, hearing the appreciation that I've been getting from people, man has been overwhelming. Reuniting with mes mad and just feeling the love.

Yes we do.

7 (23m 17s):
Oh, I think Making the Cut is out now.

1 (23m 19s):
Okay. Truth makes bangers. People don't know that because of how good he is at wrestling. Everybody just assumes he can only do one thing. Truth makes absolute bangers. I want a documentary on you. Your story is one that people are gonna learn from and love forever. Now let's speak about a story here. Ms. Oh yeah. Just within the last couple years, I fresh out of a bus. Hadn't been in a ring in six months, came out in May. Just beat your ass. Yikes.

7 (23m 42s):
Okay.

1 (23m 43s):
Just beat your ass. I

8 (23m 44s):
Was in a $10,000 suit. I was there to host WrestleMania. It wasn't expensive. I was not there to have matches. You know, especially surprise matches. And not only that, you literally had George Kittle help. You beat me. No. So it wasn't like you had

7 (23m 58s):
Devon.

1 (23m 58s):
I didn't cheat. I didn't cheat.

7 (24m 0s):
Did he have help? He had help.

1 (24m 2s):
I didn't cheat. I didn't cheat.

7 (24m 3s):
That's not called

8 (24m 4s):
Cheat. George Kid didn't hop the barrier and pushed George.

7 (24m 7s):
You pushed

1 (24m 8s):
Your taxing partner was in his I'm a dumbass era. You know. And he tried. I have never

8 (24m 13s):
Been, George been a dumb ass.

7 (24m 14s):
He's never been a dumb ass era in the he. He's allergic to being a dumb ass. That's right.

8 (24m 21s):
Yeah.

7 (24m 22s):
He's y'all. Well,

2 (24m 23s):
Maybe, maybe just more of a jackass

1 (24m 25s):
Then. Yeah. That's

8 (24m 26s):
Who are you?

7 (24m 27s):
Yeah. Donald You know. And

8 (24m 28s):
Why are you in WWE E 2K 24? you

7 (24m 31s):

8 (24m 36s):
Are you any wrestling ring? Tell him

3 (24m 39s):
Ms. Look, I know it's gonna be a tough pill to swallow. 81 overall in the game. Hey, that's, that's hard

8 (24m 44s):
Fought. Did you see my 2023? It wasn't really good. Okay. I think I had three wins the whole year to get it. 81. I was happy. Hold

1 (24m 50s):
On. Okay, let's go back.

7 (24m 51s):
Oh, now swallow

1 (24m 52s):
That. Now you're a champion. Yes. Okay. You're on top of the world. You got definitely, you got people saying Mrs. Awesome. How's it feel? This is like, like it's gotta feel pretty good.

8 (25m 1s):
Can I be truly honest with you? This is a child,

1 (25m 3s):
A dream of you to have this.

8 (25m 4s):
I think this is, this is really weird. I'm not used to getting cheered. I honestly have no idea what to do, what to say. Because I want to be liked. I enjoy, I've thrived for it for so long. And I think all you want in WWE earned respect and get the respect that you fought for your entire career. You're the fans now to be with him. It's been truly an honor and it's been incredible. And I've been loving every second of it. Hey,

7 (25m 29s):
Do not cry.

8 (25m 31s):
I'm not gonna cry. I'll be all right.

1 (25m 32s):
Connor's gonna question truth.

2 (25m 33s):
Funny enough, speaking of crying last night, I don't know if you saw, but your childhood hero, John Cena comes in, saves the day when, when something like that happens. Is that where you do get emotional? Do you kind of go back to when you were a kid watching John growing up? Or what are the feelings when you see something like that?

7 (25m 52s):
I'm glad you asked that question. I did cry. Okay. you know what I'm saying bro? I used to, every Saturday morning I would sit there, you know what I'm saying? And watch John Cena. Why is everybody laughing?

1 (26m 4s):
They were doing the same. They were doing the same damn thing

7 (26m 6s):
Every Saturday morning. Do them Open challenges dog. You can't see me bro. It was a moment in time for me man. Yeah.

1 (26m 13s):
Did you like he comes out, helps Cody. Yes. We're pun about Cody. Rhodes finishing his

7 (26m 17s):
Story. Oh my gosh, man. Cody Cody Rhodes. Y'all my childhood hero. John Cena. Get to

1 (26m 32s):
Little slow start. I didn't expect that.

7 (26m 34s):
Yeah,

1 (26m 34s):
They might be running outta juice. They might be running

7 (26m 36s):
Outta juice. Nah, Cody deserved that dog.

1 (26m 38s):
I agree. But I'm saying they might be running outta

7 (26m 39s):
Juice. Nah, y'all didn't run outta no juice. Are ya? What's up? What's up? What's up? What's

1 (26m 46s):
Up? Yeah, it is okay. No, got it.

8 (26m 47s):
I mean, if we were talking about the main event, I dare I say that. That was the best main event I've ever seen in WW restaurant.

7 (26m 56s):
You got

8 (26m 56s):
To see everything. The fact,

1 (26m 58s):
A lot of

8 (26m 58s):
People were like, I want Stone cold, Steve Austin. I love that. It was the Undertaker. Yes. 'cause the undertaker is the locker room leader. Yes. Is the person that has always put a, if he puts a stamp on you, that means more than everything. As a WE superstar. Yes. And the fact that Undertaker was out there to help Cody Rhodes says, Hey, we have a new face, we have a new era. And this is Cody Rhodes his

1 (27m 22s):
Era.

7 (27m 23s):
Tell him man.

1 (27m 24s):
Okay. Truth. You've been here 18, 19 years. Yeah. Cody Rhodes his era. you know, whenever you get that title, the company is kind of placed

7 (27m 31s):
On your back.

1 (27m 32s):
What should we know about the guy who's about to carry the company a little bit from your perspective? I

7 (27m 36s):
Think he's, he's matured now. He's a whole different Cody Rhodes finishing a book, finishing a story dog. His only room to, you know what I'm saying? For a new one to elevate So I. Think we're gonna see a lot of good stuff from Cody Rhodes

1 (27m 48s):
Coming up. How about you miss, you know, it's hard. He lives on the road. This guy Cody, he's everywhere. We all do. He loves no are not. Yeah, but I, I'm saying he's since what? I mean he, as soon as he came back, he was like three house shows. Three like every single week. Even through the torn peck. Obviously he goes out and does it. He recovers. He's back. Same exact schedule. Like it feels like he's obviously been built to do this. But it is kind of cool to watch like Michael Cole get choked up. He's like crying out there. Then you're seeing a lot of people that have been around the business a long time crying like in the back for Cody for his family. Yeah. I feel like that's a sense of the entire company almost.

8 (28m 23s):
I, I remember seeing Cody's first match at Ohio Valley wrestling when we were in developmental. And then I watched his journey from dashing Cody Rhodes to having an ugly mustache to Stardust. Yeah. Leaving, trying to find a way to become a main inventor. Coming back to WWE and saying, you know what, I am a main inventor. I'm ready for this. Failing the first time at the first WrestleMania, I think only made him stronger and made his fan base stronger and made us all want to yarn for yearn for it much, much more. And that's exactly what we did. We wanted it. We needed it. And he had to do it at this WrestleMania. And that's exactly what he did. He finished the story,

1 (28m 60s):
He went away. Very aggressive. Tattoo was placed on his neck. Yep. Yeah, it is awesome. Big one. It is awesome. Yeah. Time's a question for you champions. Yeah. Just

3 (29m 8s):
For you guys both. Okay. Listen, like Ms, I understand you're, you understand people, you know, you're the champion now. Okay. But people have always wanted to kick your ass. People have always kind of not been able to stand you Truth. You're, you're as baby of a face as You can get. Everyone loves you. Everyone loves you. But how my dad,

1 (29m 23s):
You're my dad's favorite. Bingo.

3 (29m 24s):

3 (29m 35s):
Okay. There you go.

1 (29m 36s):
You're welcome. You're welcome. You'll be at my house.

3 (29m 38s):
How are you guys gonna flip that switch in your head now from going from hey, one of the greatest nights of your professional lives that, I mean now, now the real work starts and you're gonna have that target on your back every single week. How, how do you flip that switch mentally and kinda, you know, go get what's yours now?

8 (29m 52s):
Well WrestleMania is always our new year. This is the start of our new year And. we plan on taking these titles and being fighting champions. I think we always hear, ah, we are gonna be a fighting champion. We're gonna take on everyone and anyone. But it's about elevating these titles, elevating the tag team division and making sure that we're elevating everyone and giving everyone what they want. And that is moments that will last a lifetime that will stand the test of time. We gave it to 'em at WrestleMania. We're gonna start it here at Monday Night Raw at Wells Fargo tonight.

8 (31m 25s):
You guys have made ESPN fun, exciting, and it's a lot of fun to watch you guys. I love the comradery between all of you. You can tell it's a friendship and it's amazing because when you're sitting at home and you're watching, you're like, I got boys like that. And I talk like that and I love seeing it on ESPN.

7 (31m 42s):
You sitting there, he said something nice about all the young Change your shirt. Shirt, ladies. And it. I thought I was gonna get some sort of animal on your shirt. I thought we were gonna get, you know, you don't think shirt, you wore it yesterday. I don't get a flamingo that don't care. Get some

8 (32m 7s):
Sort of wild

7 (32m 8s):
Don't dragon. Oh and Reverend ladies and and gentlemen are raw tag team

1 (32m 15s):
Champions.

7 (32m 17s):
Awesome. Tur. Hey, we're playing the music

1 (32m 23s):
Longer than a mania. That's good for them man. Huh?

6 (32m 57s):
Yeah. So cool. Hey, early.

1 (33m 1s):
I agree.

4 (33m 1s):
Yeah. Big time. Our truth

1 (33m 2s):
Does. Hey Jay, welcome back. We told Miz right to his face that you hated him. That's just how it's gonna go. He's a baby face now though. So let's remember that he's representing Ohio very well with his tag team champion. He is

6 (33m 12s):
Not, I mean I, I know Miz doesn't like to, to spread a lot of nice things our direction. So that was very nice of him. But I've been watching the miss since the real world days back in the day, way back in the day. So yeah, I've been, I've been on The Miz train for a long, long time.

1 (33m 24s):
So that's the thing about us with the miss. We generation have literally seen him since the birth of the miss. Right. On the real world. So like whenever we meet him or see him, we fire off a question from one of the last 30 years and then he's got a, well my view on it And that he gives his entire story on it. What a legend. I'm happy for the myth. I'm happy for our truth. They've beat, they've gotten their asses beat in their bodies beat down for decades now. Oh yeah. And now they're champs again and the people love them. Congrats. Hey, both of you deserve to hell out of this. Congrats. Amazing. Our big news happening today.

1 (34m 5s):
There's a solar eclipse happening. Yep. Whoa. Okay, it's go. Yep. Moon, it's coming right in front of his sun. Yes. Okay.

6 (34m 13s):
Boom. For how long? Like

1 (34m 15s):
You're more of a door than a window. Everybody's gonna be saying to the moon. It's a couple hours. Allegedly Indianapolis, Indiana is the hub of the best view of the solar eclipse, allegedly. We're clearly not there. We have reached out to Cantor, you know, of the weather channel. Yeah. See if he could stop by and let us know what this means. This is supposed to be absurd. It's supposed to be insane. They've been hyping this thing up all over the place and I think there's rockets getting sent into the sky. What the hell is going on with the solar eclipse of the heart? Yeah, they're, they're

2 (34m 45s):
Firing up rockets to try and discover some sort of invisible matter that will unlock secrets of the universe. That's field there. And. that is real. The particle collider. They're also running. Yeah, they're firing that thing up. They're firing that thing up during the solar eclipse. I am dead serious. This is what why they're doing And

4 (34m 60s):
That also wants you to study your animals today. Because animals do weird shit during the eclipse. That's

2 (35m 4s):
Their, that's their reason.

6 (35m 5s):
Like a thunderstorm too. Is this 2K on themselves?

1 (35m 7s):
Is this 2K again? Is that how they're acting about this thing?

4 (35m 10s):
Some people are, there's a section of the internet, Connor's section of the internet who thinks a lot of stuff's gonna

6 (35m 14s):
Happen. I think the world's ending today. I've heard that from people. But

1 (35m 17s):
The world's

6 (35m 17s):
Ending, I don't believe that. But I've heard that from a few

1 (35m 20s):
How roads just became our chain. Yeah.

6 (35m 21s):
Can't have that. It doesn't seem fair. Alright everybody

1 (35m 24s):
Look up to the sky when a solar eclipse happens because it's a big deal. So let's got have

6 (35m 28s):
Glasses on though after when's supposed to happen? Check your honor.

4 (35m 31s):
Three, three something. I think three

2 (35m 32s):
Something. Eastern

1 (35m 32s):
3 23 22 I think in Indianapolis is the perfect view of the moon. Right in front of the the sun. 'cause when the moon hits the sun, it's the time. It is nice. Also happening today. Cooper Deje of the Iowa Hawkeyes will be having his pro day. If you do recall who Cooper Deje is. He's the white. Yes. That is playing cornerback for Iowa and punt returner. Allegedly supposed to run 4 3, 4 2. Potentially he got injured, but he is a first round corner gonna be drafted out of Iowa. He had a punt return against Minnesota that got called back for a fou gaze call play maker, star and a man who everybody thinks potentially gonna change your talking point.

1 (36m 15s):
The FL next year. Finally debut. Yeah, everything. DB host, whenever you see an athlete is how we'll describe. Oh that's high school. Yeah,

5 (36m 26s):
Like that.

1 (36m 26s):
That's high school. Cooper Deje and two foot. This is in Iowa. No. Look pass. Obviously the guy's a filthy athlete has been, will continue to be. Yep. We're throwing Oops. Off the backboard in high school games in Iowa, whatever. I think he's sophomore first dunk or whatever the case is. Yeah. Debut. Whenever you think about what Cooper Jean could potentially become, what are you trying to judge? Is it his speed? Is it his quickness? Is it athletics? What do you think it's gonna be for? Whether or not he remains corner, which is what everybody says. But I have heard some people say this guy looks perfect for transition over to safety. What do you mean? He looks perfect? Well, for a transition over to safety, what

5 (37m 1s):
Are your thoughts? He does, he does have the body type you think he can kind of fill out a little bit more, but great athlete return guy. You see the basketball skills, obviously some head of, maybe some Jason Chor. Yeah, Dustin Fox playing with him. Smith maybe hybrid, but nah, he's a dog man. Should be probably a top 15, top 20 pick Pro day today. Obviously get a lot of scouts, get their eyes on him. He dealt with the injury miss a lot of time, but I'm excited to see him on the next level. Man. He should be a good one.

6 (37m 27s):
What do you wanna see Dee bud? If you're watching his pro day, obviously we know he is probably gonna run a fast forward. You wanna see how he changed direction, his hips, like what are you looking at?

5 (37m 33s):
His explosive jumps, the long jump, the Verts, all those things. Just seeing him move, just seeing him move, going through a full workout, him gas, going through conditioning, because once a guy has missed that type of football time, you just want to get your eyes on him. Then obviously the medical, the things we, we are not privy to. That's gonna be the most important part. I think this pro day

1 (37m 51s):
Ty as a Iowa, you see Kaitlyn Clark, you know, go do what Kaitlyn Clark has done. Yep. She's coming to the Indiana Fever and as Dawn Staley said, she's gonna elevate the next level too. Even Diana Tesi doesn't want to hear it. Little wake up call, she said coming in as a person's from Yukon talking shit about somebody that isn't from Yukon. I do believe that's potentially a part of it, but I was showing up right now. Yeah. Cooper Deje about to go crazy today at the pro day. Is that what everybody in Iowa was thinking?

3 (38m 18s):
Yeah, I think so. I'm obviously incredibly biased because I am from Iowa. But yeah, I mean you look at like, he's been one of those guys too, where if you grew up in Iowa, I think he won, I wanna say he won four state championships in her own football. He was a quarterback, went to Iowa, I think he wanted to play quarterback. They moved him to dac, which who knows, he's probably probably not getting picked, you know, in the first round if he plays quarterback instead. But I mean, one that, that was kind of the, once he got hurt last year and broke his leg, you know, going into like the big 10 championship, it was like when he was still healthy, he was like, Hey, who knows? Maybe Cooper de Eugene's gonna be playing offense. We're gonna get him several touches. Obviously that doesn't work out, but he did release that. He's fully healthy right now. And I think everyone who has watched him play and kind of knew him growing up, like yeah, the expectation is that his athletically, he's gonna be ridiculous.

1 (39m 3s):
Everybody attacked Paul Pierce for what he said Yes. About Caitlyn Clark. Sure. Standard conversation. I think in pretty much every locker room I've ever been in. So the people that are attacking him, I don't think who camps, that's like actual, that's like actual conversation. Could you imagine? Next year in the locker room, Cooper Deje locks down Justin Jefferson. Oh. Like the things that are gonna be said to Justin Jefferson, the things that are gonna be said to any wide receiver. Yeah. That gets locked down by Cooper Deje. I am pumped about that whole thing. Coming back to the NFL Ceiling league.

5 (39m 34s):
He's a dog man. And it and hey, it's evolution. Hey, this happens. All right. Come. This is the first. If, if he pans out to what I think he'll be, I mean, he'll probably be the best white corner we've seen in national football. Wow. Wow. Rider days are ahead drinking in

0 (39m 48s):
Whiter days.

1 (39m 51s):
Good luck out there, Cooper.

5 (39m 54s):
Go get him. Cooper

1 (39m 57s):
Now it is very abnormal what Cooper's been able to accomplish thus far. Sure.

0 (40m 2s):
Truly

1 (40m 3s):
Proud of him. What you go?

0 (40m 4s):
Love you Cooper.

11 (40m 5s):

1 (40m 6s):

I mean, you get to go out there every night and you get to, you get the best seat in the house to call all the action. We, we share the same moments, we share the same love for the business. We share the same love for WWE e. So yeah, it, it, it felt great

1 (42m 53s):

11 (43m 5s):
Moving. That's a lot of camera tricks right there. No. Oh, we saw it was lot of sports. Four entertainment.

1 (43m 10s):
Look, that's a long sprint. That's a hamstring or two Yeah. Rating. Especially with how chilly it was. You look damn good. And obviously you came in and little attitude adjustment for the TRO chief.

11 (43m 21s):
Oh, hey, the bloodline set the table, man. They said anything goes So, I just happened to make it on time and anything goes, you know? Yeah.

1 (43m 29s):
And obviously a Spanish announced desk got cleared off because we had some, there's

11 (43m 33s):
No, there was no way that that can stand a WrestleMania and not be broken. And I saw that it wasn't broken. Oh

1 (43m 40s):
Man. Put a body through it. Clean. Let's put a body through it. But Ms talks about how the undertaker comes out to help Cody Rhodes. And that's like the leader of the locker room for so long. So him being a part of it is a huge deal. Obviously stamping a new era, you coming out and helping, especially because Cody big baby face, obviously you coming out is like the dawning of an coming to help a new era. Is that how you saw it? Is that how you feel? And

11 (44m 3s):
So, the great thing about wwe right, is we can all speculate on, on everything. It means And. we all have our own opinion. If anyone more knows more about that than me, I, I'd be hard pressed to find that individual because for 20 years I've run down that ramp to a very mixed response. I understand that the audience is allowed to have their own opinion and were allowed to speculate on what this could mean. If, if You know anything about me, you know that I try to, I wear my values on my sleeve words like never give up, hustle, loyalty and respect. And I always want a fair chance. That's it. So in the biggest event of the year, with our most important prize on the line, I am just an advocate for a fair chance.

11 (44m 50s):
Okay. you know, I'm a huge fan of Cody Rhodes, but you also know I'm a huge fan of Roman reins. I believe Roman reins is the greatest of all time.

1 (44m 58s):
Okay.

11 (45m 0s):
Again, again, what's great about WE is you can have your opinion and you can voice yours. And I think that's fantastic. Will co will Cody Rhodes be the greatest of all time? He's put himself in a good position.

1 (45m 15s):
You're saying you're the goat pal. Where's that? They saying you're the go, you're the goat. This is a barn. You're goat. You're the goat.

11 (45m 24s):
Oh, Mike me. Aw.

1 (45m 28s):
Wow. That was more of a donkey.

11 (45m 30s):
Thank you. I was more

1 (45m 30s):
Like a jackass. That was your go.

11 (45m 33s):
That's more me. That's more me. No, no. First of all, thank you so much

12 (45m 39s):
Because

11 (45m 39s):
I, I know you don't just do that for anybody. So thank you. It means the world. Thank you.

1 (45m 45s):
But to your point there you were saying, is Cody Rhodes gonna be the greatest of all time? We'll find out tv

11 (45m 49s):
Yeah. And. that does, that's what you get when you do a live show, man.

1 (45m 56s):
This is what you get when you bust your ass for decades. Thank you.

11 (46m 6s):
So going, going back to what I said about Roman reigns, that doesn't mean that Cody Rhodes cannot be the greatest of all time. I just want people to understand that. I think what's been done so far, you have to put Roman reigns in that slot. But Cody's Cody's story set, you know, the whole, the whole theme of WrestleMania was finishing the story. His story starts today. I I told him in the ring last night, and I'm sure he will be able to relay this same message. When I got to embrace him, I, he had the championship in his right hand. And I said, do you feel that? He said, yes. I said, do you feel how heavy it is? He said, yes. I said, it will get heavier every day.

1 (46m 46s):
Oh, that's

11 (46m 46s):
Deep. Because that is the burden you bear of trying to craft the path to being the greatest of all time. I hope. I hope. And this is should be the goal for the business. Every performer should pass the torch up. So I Hope a year from now, two years from now, three years from now, we can all sit here and be an advocate that Cody Rhodes is the greatest of all time. Because that's the way it should work.

1 (47m 11s):
Awesome. You're speaking from a man who has obviously been there, done that getting goat chance. So obviously you should be taken seriously. But wrestling fans are obviously gonna be pissed about something you said in there. I love it. Of course. Something you said in there.

11 (47m 23s):
That's the beauty of what we do, man. It is, it is not universally accepted. What is universally accepted is the passion, is the energy, is the heartbeat. We all come together over this And. we all share our opinions loud and vocal. And everyone in the wwe e both talent production and audience alike, knows that we are superstars. And that you are superstar.

6 (47m 44s):
Their character. You

11 (47m 47s):
And

6 (47m 49s):
Without,

11 (47m 50s):
Without. I'm, I'm just a dude in Jean shorts, a ball cap and a T-shirt

6 (47m 56s):
And kicking ass Hell. yeah. And kicking ass in the middle of the one. But

11 (47m 59s):
Without them I'm not.

6 (48m 0s):
Yeah, but they could be no people and they're covid. Anyways, AJ's got a question

11 (48m 4s):
And sidebar. I know they were busting your ass about wearing the same T-shirt as last night. Thank you. I'm also wearing the same T-shirt as last night. Boom.

6 (48m 11s):
Boom. So we're good. Me and John C you and I were good. Of course. You guys are basically twins. John, I wanted to ask you about your life outside the ring. Yeah. Let this go. You need to soak it up. They don't get it John. They don't get it.

11 (48m 24s):
I'll, I'll change my shirt, but you guys know that comes with a uniform change. So last night wasn't my last night, so this doesn't mean this is my last uniform. Whoa, Whoa,

6 (48m 33s):
Whoa, Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa. A nice, nice, nice. What's that mean? What's that mean? We're

11 (48m 39s):
Just throwing that means that I've, I've speculated a lot about when it is that I hang up the jorts, but it is, it wasn't last night and I still got, I still got a little bit of rubber left on the top.

6 (48m 51s):
Alright. That feels big.

11 (48m 56s):
I don't wanna Bogart your question. Let's get get down to Brad

6 (48m 58s):
Now. That just turned into my question. Hey, that's breaking news there. Yeah. Yeah. That's nuts. Hey. Yeah baby John, good to see you.

11 (49m 3s):
We can, we can lean into that. We can talk about

6 (49m 5s):
You been feeling that for a while because last night reignite that, that fire, that passion. Why is it so tough to, to say like, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put this down. I'm gonna put this away for a while where I'm not going to wrestle.

11 (49m 13s):
So, so it's not tough because of the foundation I laid and the promise I made to each and every person who pays attention and gives of themselves to wwe e when I feel I can no longer perform at the capacity of the product, it is time to step away. That's not, that's not tough. Okay. The toughest thing is that I love it so much.

6 (49m 33s):
And you can still do it at a high level.

11 (49m 35s):
Yeah. So when that, when that time is gone, that means that it's done. I'm, I'm actively trying to craft that path right now. So I I've, I've put a line in the sand to myself for, for 50 and I honestly think it's gonna be before that there is your breaking news

6 (49m 52s):
Whoa. How old? How do you

11 (49m 53s):
I'll be 47 in a few weeks.

6 (49m 55s):
Oh, so we got time still.

11 (49m 57s):
You got about 700, about a thousand days to

6 (49m 60s):
Decide. Okay. Alright. That's a long time. Nothing time,

11 (50m 3s):
But, but you got this many are calling this the greatest WrestleMania ever. Right. And, and I agree. What a spectacle, what a fantastic WrestleMania. But that's because of the talent that actually put the time in. I showed up for 90 seconds. This is the greatest WrestleMania with or without my involvement, And. that is because of the now the superstars we have now and their contribution, their contribution to the business. It is gonna be time soon for me to go. And I, I'm embracing that and enjoying it. And, it allows me to be present. No,

0 (50m 38s):
No, don't go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11 (50m 44s):
I, I can say this with the utmost certainty. I will always, always be part of the WWE family. But the time to compete in the ring is coming to a close.

1 (50m 53s):
No.

11 (50m 53s):
Yeah.

5 (50m 55s):
Thousand days

1 (50m 56s):
Or less a thousand

11 (50m 57s):
Days. I'm gonna try to do it in less. Okay.

1 (50m 59s):
Well whatever the case, you look fantastic. Last, thank you very much. You said 90 seconds average 47-year-old that run out there. Stay Yeah. Oh yeah. At least four minutes for

0 (51m 9s):
Sure. 17, 17, 17, 17, 17.

1 (51m 16s):
Go get it, is what they're saying.

11 (51m 19s):
I I do not feel 17 anymore. I feel 47.

1 (51m 24s):
You're looking 20. Dbo has a question for

5 (51m 28s):
You, John. Yeah. John, this might be a stupid question because we didn't see you butt ass naked on the stage in front of the world, but do you still get nervous when you run out for that 90 seconds in the biggest wrestle ever?

11 (51m 38s):
Don't I don't believe in a construct where there are stupid questions, because I think there's a, there's something to be learned behind every question. Yep. Thank

1 (51m 46s):
You John. Like that.

5 (51m 47s):
John. Thank you, John.

11 (51m 48s):
I still get nervous for everything. I am nervous right now. So I still get nervous. Yesterday was awesome because I had such a small role. I really was able to enjoy it. And I could feel the moment where even beyond myself, my heart rate jumps and I can be like, yo, it's happening right now. It's happening. It's about to happen. And I can feel the nerves. I can feel my muscles tense up. I can feel my heart rate go from like 60 to one 10 just standing there watching the TV knowing like, it's almost time. It's almost time. I still get that feeling every single time I get to go out in front of you guys. So thank you very much

1 (52m 23s):
For that. Oh, isn't that, that's a dragon, right? That everybody's chasing that all the, you know, I, I've followed and been a fan of the business for a long time, and every documentary that comes out of somebody that's passed is like, I wish I could go get the same feeling of coming out of that curtain. And what it's like, is that the dragon that everybody's chasing forever? So I. I think that, and you think you're just gonna be able to walk away from that So, I. 'cause anytime we hear it goes, the place explodes. I mean, that is, it's just Absolutely. Yeah, exactly. That's gonna be tough not to have, right?

11 (52m 58s):
I need to go to their coffee shop, So, I. Think the dragon you talk about. I, this is just me thinking further people. That's wrong.

1 (53m 7s):
No, no. We're, we're discussing it's talk shit.

11 (53m 8s):
So, I think when they retrospectively are like, man, I just wanted to chase it. They didn't give their selves a chance to be in it. Got it. When I describe it to you as last night, like I felt all of it and I was in it, and I'm present. And I'm so grateful for the career arc that you all have awarded me because I've been able to do it in sections. I was the last pick. I was, I started out in the warmup matches. I was, everybody's go through opponent. I worked my way up to try to get some, some merit. I changed my character. I changed my look. Then I couldn't lose. And then have seen it lose as we riot. And then it became very polarizing. Then I became Superman. And now I've been around so long and I'm such a part-time contributor that I do get to be present and I do get to enjoy it.

11 (53m 55s):
So I'm being weaned off the dragon And. that is beautiful for me because I can look around and take in all these moments rather than be on that lightning fast treadmill of Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Those moments I get to show up. I really get to look around and love it and breathe it in. Happy to hear that now. So I'm being like weaned off the drag. Yeah. But

1 (54m 17s):
I'm happy to hear that you're taking it in and enjoying it. 'cause in a lot of professions, and if all professional sports,

11 (54m 22s):
This is, this is philosophy today on The, Pat. McAfee. Show, man, we're getting deep. Hey.

1 (54m 25s):
Every day, John. Every day. Speaking of here's like one of your biggest fans.

3 (54m 29s):
Yeah, John. I mean, I agree with You know, like the talent in the ring last night was part of the reason why this was the best re WrestleMania ever. But me personally, I've been in a WWE commercial in fold, John, Cena, regalia, you know, mark out appreciate you at 30 years old

11 (54m 43s):
Last night. I can say the same. I've done the same thing. Yeah.

3 (54m 45s):
Last night at 34 when your music, I mean, I'm acting like I'm, I'm 13 years old, so like it, we need you, we need you around. But I am curious in terms of chasing the dragon, we, Pat and I have talked about this a bunch. Like, do you find that kind of same feeling, I guess now with acting? Because like, no bullshit. You have incredible acting chops. I said it right after Ricky Snicky came out. I was like, John Cena is gonna win an Oscar someday. He legit is. And I, I'm curious when you first got in, if people kind of dismissed you or looked the other way because of your WWE background, but like how has that whole process been? I mean, you're a, you're a megastar in, in the acting world now as well.

11 (55m 24s):
Appreciate everything you said. I think it's just a matter of, of finding your stride one of these days. It, it might have to come at like a hall of fame or something, but I, I want to be able to thank the WW universe for getting me ready for life and the skills that I learned performing in front of a live audience that is very vocal about how they feel when something is good or when something is not gives you immediate feedback. It gives you timing. It allows you to focus on storytelling. If I'm not entertaining, U sobs are gonna tell me I'm not entertaining. Yep. So, I better sharpen my skills real quick and be entertaining If I stumble, if I pause, if I'm not on my best on Monday or Friday.

11 (56m 9s):
Oh, the sound. Yeah. Oh my goodness. You guys let me know. You guys have prepared me to take the skillset that I've learned in WWE e and and put it forth in movies and in life. And before when I did movies, I just wanted to be back in the ring. I was a young 20 something year old Invincible WE champion that wanted to be in front of this audience. Now I understand that my, my body can only do that in select times. But I have all these skills that you've given me and I wanna be able to use those skills in the frame that I have. And on movies and in television is the best way to do the do that. And I've, I really compare what's going on in my life right now to like 2006 people in wwe.

11 (56m 54s):
Nobody thought I'd ever be anything. I almost got fired. They didn't think the rap persona would work one at a time. Jump hurdle. Jump hurdle, jump hurdle. So I. Don't mind that. Everyone typecast me as like, yo, you, you do this and only this. I'm sure you had some hurdles to the climb. I'd say being a an NFL kicker

1 (57m 15s):
Swearer, a guy who was a public intoxication arrest from Indianapolis Punter. Yes. Kind of a doofus

11 (57m 21s):
That this is everybody's journey in life. I'm just so grateful to the skills that you guys have allowed me to develop because man, do I have an awesome toolkit and now maybe I can do something else or something else, or I don't know. Okay, so

1 (57m 33s):
Maybe I can

11 (57m 34s):
Be on the Pat McAfee panel. Who knows. Yeah. Who

1 (57m 36s):
Knows right now. Doing great right now. Saving me pal. Yeah. Saving all of us right now. He was talking about the Ricky Snicky character. I think more specifically because in there there's a lot of big stars.

11 (57m 48s):
Star net King

14 (57m 49s):
Star Nick Kick. If

11 (57m 50s):
You're gonna do a check, help me with some promo. Thank you to the people at Amazon. Thank you.

1 (57m 55s):
Yeah, let's get another one. Yeah, let's get a follow up to that Hero of the week. I mean, phenomenal work in there, Ricky Snicky. But like your acting chops, you were the clear star of said program. And You know talking about the Hollywood world and he said earlier, seeing you naked on the Oscar stage, the internet immediately a buzz. This is an embarrassment ritual for John Cena to have him go out there for a costume award. Okay. And do this. Has there ever been a time where you've been embarrassed to showcase that that is what your body looks like, And it. And how long have you looked like this? And whenever Are you just the guy that, if you like the idea, yeah, I'll do it. 'cause that does seem like the John Cena Hollywood guys like, 'cause what was the peacemaker?

1 (58m 38s):
Yeah. That was some of the most absurd shit of all time

11 (58m 41s):
Season two coming up. Hell. yeah.

1 (58m 43s):
So entertaining though. It's like you don't take yourself serious at all. It feels like in there. You dive right in. I think that's just who you are. And I don't think people are giving you enough credit for that

11 (58m 51s):
Type of thing. So So I think, I think I do take it seriously, but I take it seriously. Not yourself. Not me looking cool. Because if you try to look cool all the time, you're just chasing a, a perfect view of yourself. That doesn't exist, man. I know. I got a bald spot on the back of my head. I flossed, I flossed it last night at WrestleMania.

14 (59m 14s):
Hell. yeah. Yeah.

1 (59m 15s):
Hair looks spent though.

11 (59m 16s):
Me, you and like seven out 10 dudes have 'em. So, I don't care. I'm not perfect. That's not me. So I. Think instead of trying to craft every situation to how can I look the strongest or the best, I look at every sit situation of how can we make this the best situation? Ooh. When we go over the Oscar bit and they're like, ah, do you want to wear Spanx or Spandex or a Speedo? No. Make me as naked as possible. So Disney says it's too naked. That's how we go about.

1 (59m 47s):
No, I was told somebody told you that. I didn't know you were

11 (59m 50s):
A part of that. That's the, that's the funny bit. That's the, that's the gag. That's why everyone's entertained. Yeah. And I think that's what leads to polarizing opinions and that's what leads to interest. And people can have that stuff and say like, oh, this is this, but it, it is what it is. It's for your entertainment to decide what you want.

1 (1h 0m 6s):
Your cheeks on the Oscars were awesome. Incredible. As we are back on ESPN for hour two, John Cena still joining us here live from the WWE world. Conman's got a question for you.

2 (1h 0m 20s):
Yeah, John. So making the best outta the situation for Cody Rosen. Now, going forward, like when you get your championship, you know o obviously for Cody in this situation, he's following a guy that is known as the goat. Like how does he go forward and not try and replicate anything of the past and do his own thing? Like was that hard for you when you got yours to not kind of

11 (1h 0m 41s):
So sure was, and I think it was, it was hard for Roman too, and certainly hard for Shawn Michaels or Stone Cold, Steve, Austin or

2 (1h 0m 51s):
What

11 (1h 0m 54s):
All, all of those guys had enormous shoes to fill. And the way that they've connected with the audience is we, we will get some good audience participation here is by reflecting on history, but ultimately coming to the conclusion why that they should be themselves. Why?

1 (1h 1m 19s):
Yeah. Yeah. Hell. yeah. That was the most sophisticated usage of the whats I do believe, which is why you're John Cena. So you just said obviously a thousand days or whatever until you're 50, that's where you drew the line in the sand. You said you're not done. We'll see you again. You're here on Monday after WrestleMania. Yep. What is your schedule right now? Are we making movies? Are we doing, what do we have going on right now in

11 (1h 1m 43s):
Johnson as well? So. I was, I was grateful enough that Honda kind of bumped a commitment I had to be able to do WrestleMania. So I'll go from here to do something with Honda.

1 (1h 1m 51s):
Hey, are they making flying cars? Is that what you alluded to? The last voiceover?

11 (1h 1m 54s):
They're working, they're working on it too.

1 (1h 1m 55s):
I was watching that commercial. I hear John Cena's voice and all of a sudden I see something. They're jets and stuff. Yeah. Is that, that's awesome.

11 (1h 2m 1s):
They're working on some pretty cool stuff. So I'm going to straight to that. I have a cool keynote appearance with Samsung in Las Vegas. Their theme of the convention is time is now. So they called on yours truly to speak there. I'm very grateful for that. Like

1 (1h 2m 15s):
That. Your time is up.

11 (1h 2m 17s):
My time. My

1 (1h 2m 17s):
Time is now. Yeah,

11 (1h 2m 19s):
Absolutely. I have some more branding stuff to do before I leave for Europe to finish a movie that we started filming before the strike called The Heads of State with Priyanka Chopra and Idris Elba. Ooh. And then straight from that to peacemaker. Season two,

0 (1h 2m 33s):
Mark. Man,

11 (1h 2m 34s):
That'll, that'll take us through just about Christmas. And I'm crossing my fingers and toes and my heart that maybe, maybe just, maybe I can take the, I can tell the Hollywood world to pump the brakes for a while and come back to my family for one last run.

0 (1h 2m 48s):
My God,

11 (1h 2m 50s):
I hope. I don't know. I hope I'm trying. I hope We'll see what happens. We'd

1 (1h 2m 54s):
Be honored to watch that and witness that. And obviously everybody here would be excited to see one last run from Old John Cena. Well, every time we see you do something, we think it's incredibly cool. We're pumped for you wrestling guy taking over the world. You gotta go chase that at some point.

0 (1h 3m 14s):
World champion.

11 (1h 3m 17s):
Those, those shots gotta be earned, man. I don't know if you've looked at my, my record for the past three years, but it's not exactly stellar. I need a slump buster first. I need, I need a slump buster.

We're not done. Done. Yes yet. Speaking of that, we got another hour here on ESPN YouTubes, ESPN plus YouTubes ESPN plus third hour. We have Lane Johnson joining us Hell. yeah. Because we're in such a great conversation with John Cena, we are not able to take a break. So we do apologize to the linear television audience that didn't get to see three minutes of magic. But I will also apologize to my bladder that currently has to piss. Sure. We are 55 minutes away from a break, And. we will certainly do a fantastic job this entire time. Oh yeah. The WE world has continued to fill up here in Philadelphia. This event is so special.

1 (1h 6m 40s):
I think Stephanie McMahon said 65 different countries were represented here at the WrestleMania. Obviously WrestleMania Foria, I assume every single city in the country is represented. People travel here and it's a full weekend of happiness. A full weekend of good, a full weekend of celebration of the greatest business on earth professional wrestling. So thank you all for hanging with us on this Monday. And tonight. Well after mania is legendary tonight, there's probably gonna be surprises and absurd shit to kind of cap off the greatest WrestleMania weekend of all time here in the city of Brotherly Love Philadelphia. I'm not alone. Talk table is here at Boss Connor at Ty Schmidt. One half of the hammer down cowboys.

1 (1h 7m 21s):
Tony Digs is here. Darius j Butler and AJ Hocker here as well. Boys John Calipari, basketball coach for the University of Kentucky, right? Yeah.

4 (1h 7m 30s):
Yeah, that's right.

1 (1h 7m 32s):
Guy from Pittsburgh, right? Ah-Huh? Guy who has a job for the rest of his life, right? Ah, correct. The guy that made Kentucky an absolute blue blood and always in the topic of conversation college basketball. He's gonna be down there with the third BRS forever, right? You think? Yeah. Ah, he's head coach of Arkansas now. What? What John Kalari said, I'm outta here. You spelled my name wrong on the damn newspaper the day after we lost. I know. We haven't won a Natty in some time. Why don't you get off my back? It's a new world. And he said to himself, you know, when we win, it's a relief when we lose. It's devastating. There's spelling my name wrong on a newspaper that I sold more newspapers than anybody in the history of this town. Get me the hell outta here. He's now with the Woo Pig Sui group down in Arkansas.

1 (1h 8m 13s):
Yeah. Congrats to him. Congrats to to them. And now what does Kentucky do? Time. I

3 (1h 8m 17s):
Don't know this. This was crazy. I mean, this is a massive story. And, it kind of happened last night. Just, I mean, granted, we were at mania, so you, it's kind of just like, all right, whatever.

1 (1h 8m 25s):
Yeah, undertaker just came out and shot.

2 (1h 8m 27s):
Exactly.

3 (1h 8m 28s):
So it's, but but it, I mean this is, you know, I, I think once they started talking about like, oh, okay, we're, we need to get rid of Kalari, we're gonna fire him. He was like, oh, you're gonna fire me. That, that ain't how this works. I leave now. But it's weird staying in the, the SEC, like he's gonna be coaching against Kentucky. I don't know. It's just, it it almost like,

1 (1h 8m 49s):
Does

2 (1h 8m 50s):
Arkansas have to buy Kalari out? Buy out if

4 (1h 8m 52s):
You leave? Did did you hear who bought him out? Did you hear who was a major player in bringing him in? Who

5 (1h 8m 56s):
Was that over

4 (1h 8m 56s):
There? Jerry Jones.

1 (1h 8m 57s):
Oh really? Yep. What's going on over there? Jerry comes over. What's going on over there? Jerry goes over to Cal Poor. I see the way you're treating you in Kentucky. I ain't no way to be treating for a man like you. No, you're Hall fame Cal K, you're a beast. Spelling your name wrong on newspaper. Get the hell outta here. How much do I gotta pay to get you to Arkansas? You're love Arkansas. They got this chance.

0 (1h 9m 23s):
Hey Suey.

1 (1h 9m 25s):
And if you win, I don't know, you win a little bit over 500, that's a, who gives a shit? You in a tournament. They're gonna be so pumped. You can come down to Jerry World anytime you want. You got a free suite. Whatever you need. Cal Party's like, man, get me the hell outta here. Now I did see some people on the internet saying, well, Kentucky's gonna try to get Dan Hurley outta you. Caught. Ooh. Could you imagine when it back to back national championships at a place like Yukon that has how many national titles?

5 (1h 9m 52s):
16 combined Men and women the last 30 years.

1 (1h 9m 55s):
And people are just acting like, yeah, not a good job. Kentucky's a better job. Yep. Than Yukon. It's been wild to see the names of everybody expects to go down to Kentucky.

5 (1h 10m 2s):
It's wild, man. you know the money behind, behind the scenes that's, that's supposed gonna come down to these coaches. So I would expect you. I don't know what Hurley's contract integration, he's gonna get a raise is, but he's, I expect him to get a huge raise. And that Kentucky job. That's a big time vacancy. Yeah. For obviously head basketball coaches.

2 (1h 10m 16s):
But Kentucky would be the equivalent of Bama. Yes. Of of college football. Similar. So like if you do get that opportunity, you would take it. But I assume John Daley came through with two to 300 cases of chocolate milk. Probably a couple beers. I don't know what Kalari likes to drink, but I assume John Daley brought it to one golf course. Jerry flew Kalari in. Yep. He said, Hey, this is your new best friend. His name's John Dalen. You're gonna enjoy every single day in Arkansas.

1 (1h 10m 41s):
I love everything about Arkansas. What a state mor to. I had a blast there. They told me the Hell's Angels dressed like me. That's why they wouldn't let me into a bar. So then I was forced to buy a foam, sea foam green. Yep. Jake Owen.

3 (1h 10m 56s):
Jake Owen,

1 (1h 10m 56s):
Owen shirt was sweet shirt. And then I went inside me and Ryan Mallet, mallet, rest in peace. Yeah. Had time of our life. Arkansas is good people. I think Kalari is gonna love it there. And now what does Kentucky do? They just ran a legend out of town. Hope you're happy. Hope you're happy. Yikes. Speaking of happy Ahe Bia, congratulations. Yeah. In the golf world, he just wanted era of open. This weekend he dislocated his shoulder celebrating and he's a young buck. He's thin, he's attractive. He's been good for a long time. He didn't go to college. He went straight to the pros outta high school. We got a chance to chat with him, allegedly during that fist pump right there, his shoulder popped outta place. Aha. We need at least one, you know, dumbbell raise.

1 (1h 11m 38s):
Put a little muscle on here somewhere. This kid legitimately has been talked about as potentially being the future of golf. He's a superb talent and his story is phenomenal. Bet on himself. I'm gonna go do this. And his personality. Great. Happy to see him. Get a big win. And congrats on qualifying for the Masters. Congratulations. It's a good

2 (1h 11m 58s):
Story. Yeah. He's also a big son of a bitch. I feel like when we talk to him, we, we kind of got that gauge of how tall he is and he's got the smoothest swing of all time. Oh yeah. If he comes in here, I mean, are we talking about Akha Bia top five, top 10, maybe winning the frigging masters next week. Coming off of the biggest win of his career. How's his should? Is his shoulder gonna be okay? Is he gonna be able tee it up? The boys skinny, skinny guys like that? It happens

4 (1h 12m 18s):
All the time. That was on 18, I think. And then he did win in the playoffs. So. I. Think he's gonna be all right. The, I think it was, who was it, Denny McCarthy that he was going up against who was minus nine on the day, was playing unbelievable. And then he was 90 yards out and put one in the water. Like that's just how golf was. It was, it was a really good tournament.

1 (1h 12m 32s):
Yeah. PGA's doing great stuff. Excited for that. Congrats Akshay. We literally chatted with him when his caddy was a girl that he just dmd and asked if she had a free weekend. Yeah. They're now married. Yes they

2 (1h 12m 43s):
Are. Congratulations.

1 (1h 12m 44s):
He's living, he's doing it

2 (1h 12m 45s):
Right. Happy ending.

1 (1h 12m 46s):
Speaking of doing it right, bill Belichick is just hanging out in some Washington Huskies gear. Steve Belichick, former defensive assistant coach for the New England Patriots is now defensive coordinator for the Washington Huskies. And Bill Belichick is not only speaking at their coaches clinic, he's also at practice with the hoodie on. What a weapon for this Washington team to continue to build the greatest of all time. Just moseying around in some all gray sweet.

2 (1h 13m 11s):
Yeah. Jed Fish, the head coach, he was the QB coach when M was a rookie. So that, that's how he knows them too as well. Along with Steve Belichick being there. I assume the Washington Huskies, what they, they win three, four more games because of the fact, at least that Bill Belichick gave into their, their preseason and gave him some game. Probably.

1 (1h 13m 28s):
What do you think, Deebo? You got drafted up there. You think there's a chance that Bill Belichick is just gonna step away from football for a year now that nobody's hired him as a head coach?

5 (1h 13m 34s):
Nah, there's no way he can stay away from the game. I'm sure he'll be on, on, on a Zoom call with his son. Probably be tapped into the meeting rooms. But yeah, anytime you can be around, bill, you gonna hang on to every word when it comes to football? He's an absolute encyclopedia. He'll tell, he'll remind you. He'll let you know he's forgotten. More football you ever learned.

4 (1h 13m 50s):
I just, the fact that Bill's not in the NFL and he's on, he's wearing crazy. He is wearing a Washington Husky sweatsuit right now. Thank

2 (1h 13m 56s):
God. Unbelievable. Thank God too. I, I thought about that. I was so worried about the idea of seeing Bill Belichick in another team's colors uniform and other team's facility getting just a little taste. Even though it's college, it's like, okay, this is what purple. This is what Purple. If the Vikings shop was open, this is what it would look like. Maybe. Okay. There's some gold in there. Alright. Maybe. Maybe he does go to that w

1 (1h 14m 16s):
Looks like a commander.

2 (1h 14m 17s):
Yes. It it does it. It cut off.

1 (1h 14m 19s):
Well that's 'cause he's trying to show respect to the boys. Okay. I mean if he was to showcase that barrel chest in those arms that he had outta that ring video, those college kids probably transfer. Yeah.

2 (1h 14m 29s):
Plus

1 (1h 14m 29s):
They hit, they'd hit the transfer portal. He knows what he's doing with those guns. He's gotta do what he's gotta do.

2 (1h 14m 33s):
Shows up in a sleeveless hoodie. you know how long of a season it is for Steve Belichick. I mean those kids are telling Steve every day. I have. Is

1 (1h 14m 39s):
Steve okay? Yeah, he looks

2 (1h 14m 40s):
Good. What you mean Steve's Okay. Look Steve, Steve Steve's going through a transition period right now. Okay. Believe's gonna be the first time he's coaching for a team that his dad isn't the head coach. So he is transitioning into becoming his own coach without his father on the staff. So sure. Maybe there has been another trip to the dessert menu. Okay. There's been Oh, that's what you're telling me. Oh, that's what you guys are alluding to. No, we're not.

1 (1h 15m 4s):
I was talking about him being okay without his like, oh, okay. In Washington

2 (1h 15m 8s):
You that we all know Whatcha you calling him? Facts. We can allude to the internet narratives that I believe in and so can you guys, and that's okay. And I can sit here and tell you, yeah, he's been a little more stressed out. He's moving from Boston to Washington. Would you guys be stressed out if you were going from one side of the country to the other? I know I'd pack on a few if I did Whoa. With that being said, what did you say?

1 (1h 15m 31s):
What he was saying? This stuff, bro. Fuck.

2 (1h 15m 32s):
I know what you guys are talking about and that's fine. And I can make the jokes about and be the brunt of the, you know, if you will bad press around what we're talking about here being said, at the end of the day, Steve Belichick is more locked in than ever. I mean, I expect Washington's defense to be top five this year, if not top one.

1 (1h 15m 50s):
Think about Bill breaking down these college offenses right now, aj. Oh, like for Steve. And I've been looking at something. You need to do this. You need to do this. Do you think Steve wants that? I assume yes. Right? Yeah. I

6 (1h 15m 59s):
Would imagine Steve wants that. I would. I wanna see what the other coaches think though. Like if Bill comes into their defensive staff meeting. Yeah, they want Bill's insight and everything, but they're also probably as nervous as they ever been in their life trying to impress, please don't kill him. Like you're a player. You're like a player When Bill Belichick

1 (1h 16m 12s):
Out, please. Hey, so what, what is your, just

6 (1h 16m 13s):
Don't come after me right now.

1 (1h 16m 14s):
What is your weekly routine? Let's walk through it. Cool. What?

2 (1h 16m 17s):
You're

6 (1h 16m 18s):
Just making up stuff on the, on the fly. That sounds good.

1 (1h 16m 20s):
I potentially had a conversation with Bill Belichick on the phone. Okay. Really with the last couple months. And I should have known that I was signing up for, I thought it was a quick, Hey, how we doing? Just wanna let You know, just like I've said publicly numerous times. If you're gonna do TV next year, we would love to get in on the action. We would love to be a part of that. So I just wanted to call reach out, chitchat with him a little bit more. That thing was an hour long. Oh. And I gave answers. I got follow up on that one. And he remembers every follow up. There's not just like a, sometimes people will have a follow up for something that you said, but you already passed that you get to the next one. Uhuh got follow up all gotta follow up on that one as well.

1 (1h 17m 0s):
Let's put a pin in that one. We're coming back. Maybe the most diligent conversation I've had in 45 minutes and I just thought about everything he's done to players over the years. Yeah. And the, the way he looks at things and how he talks. It's like this dude's a machine. Yeah. And now he's potentially working for the Washington Huskins.

18 (1h 17m 16s):
Yes.

3 (1h 17m 16s):
Got Bill on the defensive side of the ball. And I believe Pete Carroll's son is the oc. So he's on the, you know, not a bad little coaching steps. I got up there. Good for

1 (1h 17m 25s):
Washington. Congratulations

18 (1h 17m 27s):
Coming up Ned.

1 (1h 17m 28s):
Also, congratulations speaking to Natty, to the South Carolina. Gamecock

18 (1h 17m 33s):
Congrat.

1 (1h 17m 36s):
Ron Staley and the Gamecocks have won national championship. I got some stats from mbo,

18 (1h 17m 40s):
Billy's finest

1 (1h 17m 41s):
That we're just like phenomenal to talk about. South Carolina is 109 and three in the last three seasons. The three losses are by a combined seven points. That's crazy. Okay, now let's talk about Iowa. Iowa scored 77 points versus South Carolina last year. 75 this year. Difference was South Carolina's perimeter shooting in the game. They won four 20 last year, eight to 19, yesterday 37 0 bench scoring in South Carolina's favor to hang 87 with a 20 point scorer without a 20 point scorer. Is the exquisite depth in role definition says Heba. Okay. Will Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, West Virginia.

1 (1h 18m 23s):
Hell. yeah. Pete Merovich, Elvin Hayes, Larry Bird and Tim Duncan all have not won a national championship in college. Wow. Are they not great? Oh,

18 (1h 18m 38s):
Interesting. That is

1 (1h 18m 38s):
Such a sports media thing. But it is so real because there's a lot of people saying Caitlyn Clark is only great if she wins a championship. Well, she didn't back to back finals. And the way she handled it was obviously incredible. The way she talked about what her team did, how proud she was and everybody, what they did for the sport. She said she can sleep at night pretty much knowing how she did it. Everybody else can judge it how it is. Hey Caitlyn, you were great. Yeah,

18 (1h 19m 1s):
Yeah. There's no questions asked there. No.

1 (1h 19m 5s):
And I assume if she potentially went and played on a team that had other WNBA players on it, like some schools potentially have, we might be experiencing a little bit different story, but she stayed in Iowa and lift that program up to a level that it had never been before. And also women's college basketball to a level that it's never been before alongside other superstars in the NCAA women's tournament. But yeah, you're great. You did fantastic. And I don't think there's any other conversation to have about the whole thing, Todd.

3 (1h 19m 30s):
No. And I think one of the things that's easy to forget is like the amount of pressure that was on her shoulders every single game, like needing to perform. Like we, we look at the, I mean, you see how expensive the final four tickets were everywhere she went was a sellout. It's like she, she didn't have the luxury of like, hey, I, I can't Not only because they don't really pay play anybody off the bench. Like she had to be at her best every single night she played. And for the most part she was like, I just, I don't know if we'll ever see something like this again. I mean, who knows? 'cause she and the, the women's game in general has kind of had this boon right now and has grown so much. But it, it, I don't know if we'll ever see like a phenomenon like this again in college sports.

1 (1h 20m 8s):
Yeah. And every night she showed up. She's seemingly unflappable. I mean when she broke the record, there was no hitch, no second guess, no drought, no thought. She's coming to the Indiana Fever. Yes. So Las Vegas ACEs. Congrats on a nice run Kelsey Plum. It's over now. Alright, we're gonna take a three minute break here. And then when we get back on the other side, the American nightmare, our WWE champion, Cody Rhodes will join us. We can't thank you enough for allowing us to do this every single day. We're back from WWE World on the other side. Take

0 (1h 20m 37s):
Three. Hey, what? Let's go. This

1 (1h 20m 45s):
Show stink and the fact that you listen, we are very, very thankful for it. The all time leading tackler for the Green Bay Packers. You pig.

0 (1h 20m 56s):
Stop. Stop. Damn

1 (1h 20m 58s):
It. Your friend. Tell her friend something nice to change their life. We

0 (1h 21m 1s):
Walk out, we walk out four sports, sports, sports, sports.

1 (1h 21m 7s):
Hello beautiful people and welcome to WWE World on this solar eclipse of the heart. Monday, April 8th, 2000, 24. Hour two starts. Nah,

0 (1h 21m 20s):
Four.

1 (1h 21m 21s):
Our fantastic sports are amazing. We're incredibly lucky to cover them every single day. And today's a special one because we're still here in Philadelphia, WE world. 'cause WrestleMania is winding down, but the energy is still palpable because of what happened last night. WrestleMania night,

0 (1h 21m 41s):
There

1 (1h 21m 41s):
Is a new king crown of the company. He'll be joining us in a matter of moments. Joining me now, the Toxic Table at Boston Connor and at Ty Schmidt. Ty, big time Mark have been for a long time. These WrestleMania weekends are glorious. Yeah,

3 (1h 21m 54s):
I mean it's, it's, there's no, if you love the WWE and you've never been to like a WrestleMania weekend, there is truly nothing like it. And to think back like last night, like an actual watershed moment in this company's history, for us to be there, like it's something you'll, you'll truly remember forever. If you're a fan and you've never been to one, you gotta do whatever it takes to get to one

1 (1h 22m 15s):
And. we would also like to say thank you so much for the hospitality. Absolute,

0 (1h 22m 20s):
Absolutely

1 (1h 22m 23s):
ESPN folks that sent this whole thing up. We appreciate the hell out. You've been able to create some magical moments here, some news breaking conversations that have taken place and the union here in Philly for sending all this aside. Hey, shout out to Union.

0 (1h 22m 36s):
Shout out. Shut out

1 (1h 22m 38s):
From Pittsburgh. I get the union So I understand everything. One half of the hammer done. Cowboys tone digs is your tone that national championship game tonight. Who are we liking? How we liking it? I,

0 (1h 22m 47s):
Yeah,

4 (1h 22m 48s):
It'd be insane to bet against UConn. Like it would be insane what an 11 in a row they've covered in the tournament. They, and it's not even been close. Like you basically put your feet up in the second half and just chill and count your money. Like you'd be insane to bet against. Yukon is my, is my thoughts.

1 (1h 23m 2s):
Seven and a half point favorites in a national championship is obviously absurd. I assume Painter and Edie are gonna use that as motivation on the Purdue side. It has felt a little bit different for the boilermakers this season, but they're running into Cling Kong and that's just a matter of fact. Kling Kong takes on Edie in a nine 20 tip for the national championship. Yukon wants to rain and repeat. Speaking of Yukon, Yukon legend Darius j Butler's, Hey, when we had Dan Hurley on, it felt like he had the boys ready to go. The moxie, the swagger, the confidence they had the battle against a plane being broken before getting out to Phoenix, Arizona. What are your thoughts on where the boys are and are you worried about Zach, Edie and his Purdue team that has been lightening up this

5 (1h 23m 44s):
Year? you know what, sometimes you need a little e extra adversity, like you said, mentioned 11 tournament games in a row where you covered won by double digits. Obviously it was some adversity. Getting outta Connecticut, getting all the way to country to Phoenix So. I'm sure he'll, he's been stacking those chips up on his team, on his team shoulders. So I'm, I'm excited about this one man. Just obviously worried about that, that looming job out there in Connecticut. So get a win. Kentucky. Kentucky, Kentucky. Repeat. Yeah, Kentucky. Sorry. Rain, repeat and then get re up.

1 (1h 24m 10s):
Okay, so let's talk about this. Who else on the team Ling Kong do we need to be paying attention to or needs to have a big game for them to win?

5 (1h 24m 16s):
Newton our point guard. Our guard, he just won a big time award. He's an absolute playmaker shots. We haven't been hot and Hurley mentioned it when we had a won program. Haven't been hot from behind the three point line. So maybe it's tonight we kind of get that laid off the basket. But it always starts with defense and they defend as a unit. They're deep in the front court, in the back court. I love Ededie and then, you know, take care of the rest of the other guys to

1 (1h 24m 36s):
Man. Do you think this ends with a lot of blood rushing to Zach Edie's mid area? Yeah.

2 (1h 24m 41s):
I'm assuming we're gonna get a, I got a boner clip from Zach. Edie immediately a after the game. It feels like this is their moment. Like to what you said, like it really does feel different for Purdue. I for one want them to win just because Indiana and the city are better when their teams are doing well. But someone Debo didn't mention that Cam Spencer dude who's got the moxie, I think he's number 12 for Yukon Guard. I worry about him. He gets soaking wet behind three.

1 (1h 25m 6s):
The thing about Purdue is, you know, the sports world needs somebody every once in a while to come around and knock off the champion. That's right. you know, Yukon said they want to reign and repeat and Perdue said not against us. There was a man that was walking into this WrestleMania and he was being tasked with potentially trying to do the same thing that Perdue is gonna be trying to do tonight. Knock off the dominant champion, change the entire story, change the narrative, and then ride off into the night with something that your family has never really had.

1 (1h 25m 47s):
Ladies and gentlemen joining us now, your WWE champion, the American Nightmare Cody

Weekend.

19 (1h 30m 9s):
One of the biggest differences in WWE now versus the first time I was here is it's such a team mindset. And that's a rare fleeting thing in pro wrestling where everybody is working for this collective goal. So business is incredible. We gave our flowers to the crew, to the talent and all that. But you guys here in Phil, Adele.

0 (1h 30m 32s):
Damn. Woo.

1 (1h 30m 35s):
Hey, last night. Last night it was a little bit warmer as the WWE universe Chancellor Champions

0 (1h 30m 42s):
Day Hell. yeah.

1 (1h 30m 50s):
So last night I kept saying it was the biggest night of your life. I assume you felt the exact same way. You're getting another opportunity at the Universal WWE Undisputed championship in our tribal chief, the most dominant reign in the history of the title. Did you feel it early in the match? Did you, at, at what point were you like, you know what I'm, I'm beating the hell from Saturday night, which you did get your ass beat. Oh yeah. Oh, on Saturday night Bloodline Rose. I don't even think you could have pinned them on Saturday night. There was no way you were gonna win that with the way the Rock was talking to the ref. It felt like you were kind of bamboozled all along little bit. But on Sunday, was there a moment in that match where you're like, okay, there's a chance I'm gonna become champion tonight.

1 (1h 31m 33s):
Was that all day? How did you feel?

19 (1h 31m 34s):
I kid you not, and this was a big thing with folk style amateur wrestling. So much of that game on the mat is a mental thing. That match is almost always over before you ever go out there and shake hands. Just, there's this element of seeing your opponent, of knowing who they've wrestled and who you've wrestled, all that. I swear to you I knew that I was winning this thing the moment I came up that elevator, the moment I came up, I, I just, I don't want to say anything vul or anything like that, but I am just so tired and being called a number two, all of it just, it just wasn't gonna happen. We weren't gonna, we weren't gonna leave Philadelphia without taking the

0 (1h 32m 20s):
1 1 1, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one.

19 (1h 32m 29s):
That feels good. That feels good guys.

1 (1h 32m 34s):
Top guy, Cody Rhodes here obviously with our new title and before the boys have their questions for you, can we talk about how emotional, like not only the WW universe that has been dubbed to Cody Cry Babies in which there are many, but even when he

0 (1h 32m 51s):
Cry and that's road. There we go. Road, road Road. Wow. Oh man,

19 (1h 33m 4s):
You guys, you guys have really made Mama Roads cannon now You know.

0 (1h 33m 8s):
She really, she's,

19 (1h 33m 10s):
She never wanted to be signed up for any of it. And then now it's a whole thing. And yeah, mama Rhodes, I feel she's got a score to settle on her own with the Rock and maybe his mom. Oh,

0 (1h 33m 21s):
Oh Okta. Oh, Okta Johnson. I don't know sweet lady.

1 (1h 33m 26s):
But let's talk about it because of Mama Rhodes, because of your family, because of how long you've been around this industry. 'cause of there's Mama Rose right there looking on

0 (1h 33m 34s):
And your

1 (1h 33m 35s):
Father-in-Law. Good believe

19 (1h 33m 37s):
That's Otis. My father-in-Law, that's my nephew. Kellen Maris. Brian, my sister Teal, my first best friend there. Yeah, that's the crew.

1 (1h 33m 45s):
And Brian. Yeah, Brian back there. Yeah. I

19 (1h 33m 47s):
Didn't really get, Brian is his love, but that's Brian what weapon?

0 (1h 33m 49s):
Yeah.

1 (1h 33m 51s):
Back there in the suit of this entire thing. But it wasn't just your family that was emotional. It wasn't just

0 (1h 34m 7s):
Ky.

19 (1h 34m 9s):
Y'all got, y'all gotta gonna get funky like a monkey.

1 (1h 34m 15s):
For those that don't know, the fans were just chanting Dusty, the American dream, who is Cody's father? Who

19 (1h 34m 21s):
Is no way

1 (1h 34m 22s):
Is the basis. Well for people that don't know, Cody is the basis of this entire hunt for this particular title. Yes, sir. Which is why I think everybody who's ever been in the business got emotional last night. Michael Cole was crying watching this thing. We go backstage in the gorilla, everybody is crying in jubilation. And then I hear this story about this Rolex that was gifted to you was last night, the perfect night was last night. A moment that you get a chance to like take in all your hard work. Did you feel that?

19 (1h 34m 53s):
I think you just really hit it on the head last night. And I'm my own biggest critic. Everything can always be better, no doubt. But last night I felt was the perfect match and the perfect moment in my career and I just,

0 (1h 35m 13s):
It's

19 (1h 35m 13s):
Like it ne it's like it never ended. you know, you the moment in the ring with all the fans there in the stadium, then a moment with your peers backstage. Not to mention I would never ask any of the boys to stay behind for the end of the night. Most guys like to get to their bus, get to their hotel room. The fact that I got to see Jay uso, I got to see LA Night. I got to see, see him punk. Yeah. Y'all, y'all wanna get

0 (1h 35m 42s):
Oh my Yes.

19 (1h 35m 44s):
Alright, we're gonna do one and together on three, we're gonna give him big yeet. 1, 2, 3 Y Jay, see him Punk. Randy Orden, my mentor in the business.

0 (1h 35m 56s):
C Yeah. C, CCO. And the,

19 (1h 36m 3s):
The, the man you just, you just had here, the, the quarterback himself. John. Cena. Just, just an incredible, I I I couldn't, couldn't believe it. Couldn't ask for anything better than that. No doubt

1 (1h 36m 16s):
Taker went back to wherever the hell undertaker goes.

19 (1h 36m 19s):
Heart's unknown. Yeah.

1 (1h 36m 20s):
Bingo. He couldn't stick around and celebrate with you. But I may or may not have seen him later in the evening and he was obviously emotional as well. Everybody's pumped for you, brother. You're the right guy is what everybody says.

0 (1h 36m 32s):
Thank God

1 (1h 36m 33s):
Everybody believes it. This doesn't happen a lot in anything. Darius has a question for you. First

5 (1h 36m 38s):
Of all, first of all, congratulations once again, finishing your story and obviously starting another one on Friday. You mentioned you didn't necessarily love how the title looks. How much thought have you put into the new look you're gonna put on it?

1 (1h 36m 49s):
Yeah, I see Robin's still on here. Yeah,

19 (1h 36m 51s):
It's weird. A couple thi I mean, this, this is so fresh. This came from the ring. Normally today you can hand it off to the TV truck, but for me, I'm old school. If I have the belt, the belt's gonna go everywhere with me. Absolute love that. I I the side plates haven't been changed yet. The tribal chief's plates are still on there. But a co a a couple things and I think we should probably just come right out with it. I am very, this is what I got in the ring. Oh yeah. So there's a level of specialness to this equity that's been put into it that I have a warm feeling about So I feel differently about it today.

19 (1h 37m 33s):
However, that said, I had changed the title previously in the past.

0 (1h 37m 41s):
Intercontinental,

19 (1h 37m 44s):
I am not in charge of anything. I am no longer an EVP. I have no stroke other than the fact that I'm the champion. But I just think it would be special perhaps to see a particular championship one that I grew up on and that's, they know what's coming. That is,

0 (1h 38m 17s):
I,

19 (1h 38m 18s):
Again, I'm not in charge of anything. Triple H is in charge of things, but you guys are damn right. The Wing eagle

1 (1h 38m 29s):
Who's excited to see it

19 (1h 38m 31s):
And And a guys, if it, if it doesn't happen, just don't get mad at me. Okay. you know what? I'm like just You know. I'll do what I did the last time. I'm gonna try my best. So thank you guys. And

1 (1h 38m 43s):
You're the champ bud. Yeah. Got a lot more stroke than you think you do. Oh yeah. Even more so and even bigger whenever you were an EVPI, I think you got even more stroke now, pal. I think that's how that goes. Tone Diggs, who was once a bloodline. Knowledger. That's right. And then you sat on this chair on Friday and turned him. Yeah. Oh, he, he was a part of the American nightmare all weekend. Yep. Tone. Got to experience 48 hours as a Cody Rhodes fan. And. it was the best 48 hours that he could ever have. Yeah.

0 (1h 39m 11s):
He, he got, yeah, that's

1 (1h 39m 15s):
Crazy. On the wo So he has a question for you, Cody.

4 (1h 39m 17s):
Yeah. That was after you won And. that was, so in that section I was kind of self-appointed representative of the Cody Cry babies. But I, but after you won, it was so cool to see because everyone who was there who was rooting for Roman during the match was kind of just like so appreciative of what was going on in the ring. And just like, no one, I don't think anyone who was rooting for Roman during the match was upset that, that you won that match. Everyone in the crowd just was, was mesmerized at how cool it was. Everyone coming down the, your family going in the emotion of it all. Like how does it feel that in that moment after you won, it kind of felt like the entire stadium was like, oh, that feels right, that feels good.

19 (1h 39m 58s):
Well, I feel that everyone waited and truly it's difficult in this day and age to keep the attention and keep the faith and as a a, I guess a good guy on the program, that's the hardest thing, especially 2024 to keep their faith. And I am so blessed and lucky that I was able to keep their faith and to pay it off. But Roman, one of the things I took and I I noticed this Saturday night right out of the gate, Roman showed up not like a champion ready to hand off his championship. He showed up in the best shape of his career. Goats. He, he showed up as the best incarnation of the tribal chief.

1 (1h 40m 44s):
Thank you Roman. Thank you Roman.

19 (1h 40m 46s):
And, and every, everything. Yep.

1 (1h 40m 53s):
Sorry,

19 (1h 40m 53s):
I, I don't agree with how Roman was champion. We, we go about how we operate in the ring completely differently. But still, I said this last night at the press conference and I really mean it, I'm proud that I beat him at his best and I hope, I hope that I can be half the champion that Roman reigns was, he was an exceptional champion for wwe e did a lot of great things. Really do hope I can

1 (1h 41m 16s):
How your work ethic tells us that things are gonna be just fine as champion, but everybody wants, you know, hey, everybody's gonna want you go top of the mountain. Okay, here we are now you are the ah of the prize. That's how it's gonna go. I think you're ready for it. Also, you talking about rum being in the best shape. I don't know if you've seen any pictures of you've Yeah.

19 (1h 41m 35s):
Hey, you, hey, I got, I got, I got pretty lean and mean. You did. I got pretty lean and mean. Yeah, no, it WrestleMania brings that out and, and You know there's so many guys now on, on the roster that it's just such a different vibe. Backstage. You've seen it in terms of training, hydration prep. I, I gotta mention that the day of WrestleMania, I was so appreciative to be announced as a official prime athlete. That that's another thing. You know John mentioned the burden that comes with a championship, but all these responsibilities, if I'm not ready for them, that would be crazy. I've spent my whole life trying to get ready for 'em.

19 (1h 42m 16s):
So I. Think we're there. I was, I was dialed in last night under 10% on the body fat. That was exciting and happy to see what I did. The check. Yeah, no, I, and, and he was dialed into, and I, and I think that's because of, because of them. They, they, they only WWE fans, wrestling fans, the WWE universe, particularly Philadelphia. It can only be excellence. Anything less than excellence. Get the hell out of there. It's, it's got, you've gotta be excellent. And the, you guys have brought that out of all of us. So much appreciated, much appreciated.

1 (1h 42m 51s):
Especially whenever, you know, this one's getting tossed around. Company got put right on your back last night, Cody. Yeah, man. It's in a good spot. Ty is a question for you. Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 1s):
Cody, first and foremost, congrats. That was, I mean, I I think we can all agree Greatest man event.

1 (1h 43m 6s):
Hey, we'll acknowledge. Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 7s):
Yeah, we will. Yeah. We will acknowledge

19 (1h 43m 9s):
You guys. Acknowledge you guys have won. You've won like eight times. We I got it. No,

1 (1h 43m 12s):
We're acknowledging, we're acknowledging, acknowledging, acknowledging

3 (1h 43m 15s):
Your No, but I asked you on Friday about, you know, the whole finish your story thing and then how today with it being opening day, like the, the real world, the real work starts. Excuse me. How difficult will it be to kind of find the juice when you've just come off the most, you know, I, I assume stressful and cathartic and adrenaline filled weekend of your life. Like how, how do you, like now you gotta go to work again tonight. And, and tonight's arguably more important than this weekend. Hey,

1 (1h 43m 41s):
Sweet. Off season. Yeah. Sweet. Off

3 (1h 43m 43s):
Season. Hope you enjoyed it.

1 (1h 43m 45s):
It was like four, five hours last night. I think

19 (1h 43m 46s):
There, there was the off season. Well I do have adrenaline in my soul, so that's a good thing.

0 (1h 43m 52s):
Hell. yeah, we're good.

19 (1h 44m 19s):
Okay.

0 (1h 44m 21s):
If any of these being my soul,

19 (1h 44m 23s):
If any of you are just regular sports fans are watching right now, I, I hope this doesn't bother you. I hope you just see the magic that is pro wrestling and sports entertainment and ESPN es ESPN being wonderful. The golden boy of ESPN here. Just outstanding. I answer your question. I told my wife a few months ago, shout out Brandy. I said, shout out to Brandy Rhodes for sure.

0 (1h 44m 52s):
Brandy, Brandy, Brandy.

19 (1h 44m 57s):
I, I told her, I said, you know, if I won the WWE championship, if I just did it right, if I won finally got this, I think I, I think I'd feel complete, right? And she's just hip to it. And she looked at me and she goes, no, you'll just want more. And the truth is, the moment he hit three thinking I'm gonna be expended, I'm done. My soul's left my body, all this Charles Robinson slaps me on the mat. The moment that happened, I felt like just a complete bolt of lightning in my body. I I I instantly started thinking about all the things I would like to do.

19 (1h 45m 38s):
Do I want to make a new list with opponents? Do I want to be on both shows? Do I want to change the title? Do I want to add these layers? I just instantly, she was right. I instantly went to what's next 'cause to you. you know, we're joking about it, but we don't have the off season. It's one of the special things about us. But I, I want to make sure coming off of Roman's significant run

0 (1h 46m 6s):
Three letters. Oh, you come on. Well, come on.

19 (1h 46m 13s):
You know what was awkward and if he's listening to this, he'll know his ex-girlfriend painted that picture of me getting busted open by the Rock, you know? And the Rock

0 (1h 46m 23s):
Bought it.

19 (1h 46m 24s):
Yeah. And the Rock bought it and I felt bad 'cause I had ghosted like, ah, You know you gotta stand by your guy though. you know what I'm saying? You stand by your boy. mj F's my boy. Shout out to mj f's good, wonderful kid.

0 (1h 46m 37s):
Alright, Tim,

19 (1h 46m 38s):
Wonderful kid. Huge, huge, huge future. I forgot what I was saying. Do you

0 (1h 46m 43s):
Remember when you threw

1 (1h 46m 44s):
Me into the jackpot when you and MJF were doing your thing over there at a, you were like, I think Pat McAfee wants to come to a w every single week. You remember, remember when he did that to me? Cody

19 (1h 46m 52s):
So I. Remember not only when I did that to you. I remember last night when I apologized for doing that to you, there is a thing in the business and it's Brian Danielson put it out there. And I didn't love it at first, but I can lean into it a little bit. There's a thing in the industry called a Cody lie. I don't love the term, but I have been known to make hyperbole Sure. Of things on occasion. The rule is it can never be about anything serious. But I, I do like to come on. It's, it's,

1 (1h 47m 26s):
It was awesome. I just wanna let you know was

19 (1h 47m 27s):
Awesome. It's sports, entertainment, you know, it's pro wrestling. You know you can, when the legend becomes fact, you print the legend. But yeah, no, that's, I apologize for that Pat

1 (1h 47m 35s):
Dawn. It was awesome.

19 (1h 47m 36s):
Also, I was jealous of a match that he had. 'cause he showed superb athleticism. And when I came on here the other day thinking that Pat was gonna be all just abrasive with the bloodline love and the Roman and the tribal chief and the acknowledgement, and he wasn't, he was beautiful and generous and as you all were, but I was ready in the pocket. In the pocket. I was ready to say, Hey, well Pat, you know what, if I win that title on Sunday, maybe we wrestle for that chance Whoa.

0 (1h 48m 5s):
I was ready. I was ready. Now

2 (1h 48m 8s):
You have, now you can

19 (1h 48m 9s):
Offer And. we didn't have to do it

0 (1h 48m 10s):
Though. We didn't have to do it. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh no. Yes. How? Right

19 (1h 48m 19s):
Here, triple H is watching this. I'm already in trouble for trying to change the title. Now I'm trying to, to book a match. I have no power again, with stating it. Others

1 (1h 48m 29s):
Deserve the match. Obviously when the time comes, I'll smack the taste outta your mouth, boy. And I'm gonna take that hand and I'm gonna go shake Mama Rhodes' head. Oh

0 (1h 48m 41s):
My God. Get outta here.

19 (1h 48m 44s):
Well, I guess, okay, if you smack me and then you, you know, you go over and you shake Mama Rhodes. I guess if I beat you, I'll just take over your show. Whoa.

0 (1h 48m 53s):
Oh, Cody.

1 (1h 48m 55s):
A SP

19 (1h 48m 56s):
ESPN. You're looking at the new Golden Boy right here.

1 (1h 49m 1s):
I think, I think the ESPN people will be pumped about that. you know, champ, from what I've been told, champ, no, I'm, I've had too much respect for everything you've done. I've watched you whenever you were at a EW, because you're must watch. That's what you became. You built yourself into that. So I've been a fan for a very, very long time. I just, you know, rubbing rains, put some food on a table, You know for ThunderDome for a long, long time. But I'm nothing but a big fan of yours, pal. Pumped with this. And thank you for the drinks last night. Connor's got a question for you, champ. Yeah. Cody,

2 (1h 49m 34s):
O obviously you just said, you know, you win the title and you're, you're thinking about the next thing. But like today, the conversation is that was the greatest WrestleMania match, possibly just wrestling match of all time. Like, when you look at it, is the conversation today, like when you look back on it, did you kind of notice or pick up on the storylines that were happening inside of obviously the biggest storyline of the wwe of the past three years? Like, did, did you see kind of how people reacted to Seth being your shield as a shield member where, you know, Roman and his beef, you know, goes back all the way 10 years and obviously, you know, Cena in the rock, in the ring and the rock and undertaker in the ring, like all those things.

2 (1h 50m 14s):
Unbelievable. Was, was that something that you kind of thought of or kind of could take in after the fact?

1 (1h 50m 18s):
Before you answer this, we have 20 seconds until we have a hard out on ESPN. We will continue on YouTube and ESPN Plus with the American Nightmare, brand new WWE Champion Cody Row.

0 (1h 50m 32s):
I'm here from WWE world.

1 (1h 50m 35s):
Well, after many, it'll be worth a watch. You're on the Today Show this morning. How was it? Did you crush it? Did you just

0 (1h 50m 40s):
Absolutely crush

1 (1h 50m 41s):
It this morning,

19 (1h 50m 41s):
Cody? I did feel like I crushed it. Yeah. Yeah. But I cheated a little bit. What

1 (1h 50m 45s):
Do you mean Whoa?

19 (1h 50m 46s):
We gave our friends of the Today Show, who was great luck for me. 'cause I saw 'em last week to be able to come back this morning. We gave them their own championship titles, so, oh, you know, had the interview been going south, which it wasn't lovely people, I at least had the titles, you know. Cody,

2 (1h 51m 2s):
Where's yours? Pat.

19 (1h 51m 4s):
Oh, are you guys not bringing theirs out? Oh, man.

0 (1h 51m 10s):
Huh?

19 (1h 51m 11s):
They must have got lost. Oh no. That must have sent 'em the first take on accident. I'm sorry. Oh,

0 (1h 51m 16s):
Whoa Cody.

19 (1h 51m 19s):
Shout out to my man. Steven a you know.

1 (1h 51m 30s):
Ty has a question for you, Cody.

0 (1h 51m 32s):
I just wanna know who's next. Yep.

19 (1h 51m 39s):
I think

0 (1h 51m 45s):
That'd be awesome.

1 (1h 51m 46s):
He's 275 pounds right now. Hey, RKOI

19 (1h 51m 50s):
Think not to, not to just kick kick the can down the road, but I think tonight's Monday night raw and Friday night SmackDown will probably inform our audience where we might be heading in the future.

0 (1h 52m 7s):
Good tease. Good tease.

19 (1h 52m 10s):
It's all it can be at the moment is, is, is, is a good tease. But guys, I mean, you're, you're all around here. You've been here all week, you've enjoyed WrestleMania.

Anyways, let's move along. We have a guest Superbowl Champion Guest. Lane Johnson. Thank you for joining us, buddy. Elaine. Okay. You have a, you have a cameraman. You have a cameraman who has his own logo on a hat he is wearing on his, his head. Shout out dk, shout out dk dk. You're doing it.

22 (1h 57m 5s):
Yeah, So I mean the week leading into it. They don't tell you much. They just told us, you know, the day of be there a few hours before. So we got to rehearse, found out what was going down. And then earlier in the week, Kel was, was filming. He was wanting to go to Monster factory. So go where, you know, training, training. And so get that. And so we did that for a little bit earlier in the week. Learned some moves, learned some stuff. And then, yeah, I got the chance to go out and, and man, it was, it was awesome. It

1 (1h 57m 33s):
Was fantastic. Now people are saying it was pretty obvious it was you two the whole time. I think you guys are in good discussion. Yeah, yeah. I think that people are saying, look at the milky Lucid doors. Who are these guys? Look at all that meat. Who are these guys? They the biggest lucid doors of all time. Who the hell are these guys? We knew immediately. Those are world champions underneath those lucid door masks. Where's that mask live now that you had on your head during that moment?

22 (1h 57m 52s):
It's at the house. So yeah, they handed that, you know, at the rehearsal and rehearsal. Yeah. I mean, you really couldn't think

1 (1h 57m 59s):
Excuse, there was no rehearsal. What

22 (1h 58m 0s):
Are you talking about? I mean, in your mind, walkthrough. Yeah, but I mean, we couldn't, you couldn't see much out of it. And they snuck us there right before the match when the lights went down. And so, yeah, I mean we kept it on the whole time. So it was, as you see, I, I couldn't even tell he took his mask off And that I,

1 (1h 58m 15s):
Well Jason, Kelsey's obviously living his best life as are you alongside Ray and the rest of the LWO. Congrats on the Hey. Hey.

22 (1h 58m 24s):
Hey. You should see that dismount. It was close. Yeah, very close. It was. It was close.

1 (1h 58m 28s):
Close to what? Busting

22 (1h 58m 29s):
His

1 (1h 58m 30s):
Ass. Oh yeah. Well he jumped over. He did

22 (1h 58m 32s):
The best. Exactly.

1 (1h 58m 32s):
Yeah. Yeah, he went over the top of the rope. He felt very good. You guys crushed it. Just like you do everything. Let's talk about what life looks like without Jason. Kelsey next year. Yeah. With the Philadelphia Eagles, obviously you and him are very close. There's a picture in one of the hallways of the Philadelphia of the link, and it's Jason Kelsey running out of the tunnel. And then literally Ray Johnson right there. Yeah. Hell. yeah. You two are like a tag team, obviously, and have been for one of the greatest offensive lines in the NFL for the last five, six years. What's it gonna be like without him and have you thought about life without him around every single day.

22 (1h 59m 5s):
He was my tag team. Jumped a snout, jumped a snap count partner for 11 years. Yeah.

1 (1h 59m 10s):
All sides.

22 (1h 59m 11s):
Exactly. So now, hey, this is gonna be an interesting year. I gotta get a new cadence. You know it was gonna be a lot of eyes. You know, last year I thought I was gonna get 58 penalties. I got about about eight, so, so yeah, that's what I'm really worried about. But yeah, having him retire Fletch, I mean, really it's Jake, Rick Lovato and, and Brandon Graham that's left with the Super Bowl team. So yeah. But excited, excited about some of the new additions. Excited about the draft coming up. So, you know, hopefully this will, this will be a big season for us

1 (1h 59m 39s):
Is big Dom. Okay. I saw him with a boot on, I think I saw him with a boot on the

22 (1h 59m 42s):
Phone. I think he, I think he just had foot surgery. I'm not sure if it was Liz Frank, but it looked pretty bad.

1 (1h 59m 47s):
Big Dom we're happy to see you back. Yeah,

6 (1h 59m 49s):
He's

22 (1h 59m 49s):
Peace. Yeah. He needs, he needs to be back covered.

1 (1h 59m 51s):
Big Dom needs to be back. AJ's got a question for you. Lane. Lane,

6 (1h 59m 54s):
How's Coach Sirion doing? We're big fans of coach here on This program. And, we, we heard the whole situation when Big Dom gets taken off the sidelines, all of this stuff, how much he actually helps the coach. What's it gonna be like this year? And what, what, how do you think the off season's gonna start up with you guys? And like what does he bring to the table? Coach Sirianni, other coaches might not do.

22 (2h 0m 10s):
I just think he's a great communicator, you know, from top to bottom. So throughout the struggles, even in the late part of the year, we were very vocal with each other. Obviously couldn't get a good plan together to fix it, but at the same time he knew where you stood. And then, yeah, I mean big, big Dom has a big responsibility every year we have a pretty good track record with, you know, guys not having too much trouble in the off season. So Dom works a lot. And then during the season, you know, there's a lot going on. He's gotta protect a lot of people, but he is like the team's Papa Bear. Do you have any problems? Any of that? He's there.

1 (2h 0m 41s):
Hell. yeah.

22 (2h 0m 42s):
Hell. yeah. Legend.

1 (2h 0m 43s):
Old papa Bear. Dom. He's so pizano. It's ridiculous. Yeah, the glasses, the hat

22 (2h 0m 49s):
And everywhere. Everywhere he goes downtown, everybody's like the mayor of Philadelphia. You know Right.

6 (2h 0m 53s):
What's going on? you know? Good

1 (2h 0m 54s):
For him. Hey Tom, we wish you were in Indianapolis for sure. Debuts got a question for you later. Yeah.

5 (2h 0m 58s):
First of all, you know, triple OG now in the league and on your team, how does the body feel and what was your first reaction when you found out Saquon Barkley was coming over from the Viro?

22 (2h 1m 7s):
My first reaction was how in the hell they let him go And, and especially to us. So yeah, I mean, the body's feeling good. No surgeries. So really You know from that standpoint. I had a, I had a pretty good healthy year. Yep. But yeah, man, excited about the guys that we, we brought in drafts not too far away, so you know, on paper we look good, but we start OTAs, I think here next week, two weeks.

1 (2h 1m 31s):
Yeah, of course. you know? Sure.

22 (2h 1m 32s):
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, we have that. And then, and then mandatory. Yeah, mandatory. I said mandatory. Yeah.

1 (2h 1m 40s):
You'll be there. Yep.

22 (2h 1m 40s):
And then now I'll be there and then, yeah, I mean a few weeks later I'll be ready for season. Okay.

1 (2h 1m 44s):
Tone's got a question for you. Lane.

4 (2h 1m 45s):
Yeah, lane. cj, gj, Chancy, Gardner Johnson, back on on your team. Said something about some things about the Eagles fans. You think that's gonna be water on the bridge? Eagles fans will forget about that soon as he makes play or

22 (2h 1m 56s):
Yeah, some, you know, sometimes you say some bad things to your family, you know? Yeah, you're right. Some stuff, some stuff you, you like to have back. So yeah, we've all been there, been there earlier in my career. So what I do like about having him back, just how passionate he is. And you can see it. He does, he brings a lot of energy to the group.

1 (2h 2m 10s):
Do you think you guys lost Edge last year? What do you think?

22 (2h 2m 13s):
Yeah, when you lose your last six or seven, you lose something. We lost edge. Is

1 (2h 2m 17s):
It the edge?

22 (2h 2m 17s):
What is it? We lost edge, we lost hair. And, we lost sleep, we lost a lot. So, yeah, man, just, it, it became where games that were usually pretty easy to manage. We were just getting blown out And. it was like we had a pretty good ship going. I don't know where the, you know, the directions of it is headed, but I know we battled. I know it wasn't an effort problem. And you know, sometimes later in the year you play a lot of good teams, it's bound to happen. So moving forward though, it's gonna be a big year. I mean, you know, quick turnaround here, so yeah, man, I'm excited. Okay.

1 (2h 2m 49s):
Yeah. Connor's got a question for you late. Yeah. With

2 (2h 2m 51s):
Those changes, obviously you guys, new oc, new dc Kellen Moore comes to town, Fangio too, but obviously Kellen affects you. Have you had more dialogue with him or is that something offensive line

22 (2h 3m 1s):
Doesn't really work? No, no, I haven't got to talk to him, but Oh no,

1 (2h 3m 4s):
He hates you. Oh. Oh no. Kellen Moore hates offensive lineman. He like Lane Johnson more specifically. Classic break

22 (2h 3m 10s):
Quarterback. Yeah, it's a, it's a slow, slow error right now. We're not really communicating to OTAs. So, I don't know. But no, I, I remember growing up him at Boise State. Oh yeah. Setting all these records, the man, and he is really had a lot of success in the league. Yeah, I know. He does a lot of things pre-snap, lots of motions trying to disguise. So I think his track record speaks for himself. I heard he is a very vocal guy too. So yeah, I'm looking forward to see how it all blends.

1 (2h 3m 36s):
Okay. You brought us these because you're always willing to

22 (2h 3m 40s):
Protect somebody.

1 (2h 3m 41s):
Amen. Can't see shit outta these. I didn't know these were real. I thought this was all fake and gimmick. Nope. you know, I thought it was just bullshit. Why is everybody putting this cardboard on their face? It's the real deal. But you protect people. That's what you do for a living at a very high level. You jump off sides. Everybody else says, but you're right on time.

22 (2h 3m 56s):
I say, then he put them glasses on to watch the game. Hey, you know, you've seen, well this what

1 (2h 3m 60s):
This's, what some of the refs do have on whenever you're jumping off sides, it seems like it's what everybody's saying, but the guy you protect, Jalen hurts, obviously. It gets a massive deal. Yeah. Everybody starts talking about how the end of the season is. What do you expect from Jalen, from what You know from him for this upcoming season? And how do you think he's handled all this, all this, you know, a lot of change, I guess.

22 (2h 4m 18s):
Yeah. Well, I know he is getting with the guys. So as you know, being a part of the team, you have your O line D line, and then the offensive defensive guys kind of separate So I know they're working out in Houston right now, getting ready. you know, I think having Sequan here is gonna take pressure off everybody. Having a guy, that dynamic ability in the backfield be able to take some pressure off a lot of guys. but, you know, as far as Jaylen, he's always, he's always worked. Nothing's really changed from that. Fuck. He does a good job of ignoring the noise as best that he can. So

1 (2h 4m 47s):
How long did you guys not have those glasses on? I, I was sitting every here. I couldn't see anything. Well, yeah, that's

6 (2h 4m 51s):
Why we had 30 seconds. I thought these, I didn't think that. I thought you'd just walk outside with normal glasses. Apparently that's not true. I,

1 (2h 4m 57s):
You can't see shit, shit.

22 (2h 4m 58s):
I would've fried my eyes. I talked, I talked about 12 Philly scientists on the street and they said, you gotta have them glasses on or, or you're gonna be blinded. So

1 (2h 5m 4s):
It's a big day solar eclipse to the

22 (2h 5m 5s):
Heart. It's huge. Yeah, it's huge.

1 (2h 5m 7s):
How do you feel about the city of Philly? Obviously you're gonna have to say you love him, but whenever Jason Kel gave his retirement speech, he talked about like his interaction with the city of Philly and now the city of Philly can make you better. Do you feel like that's happened with you? He told a story about Zach Ertz, where Zach Ertz, you know, shot away. And rightfully so. He says in the retirement speech, Philly killed him and then Zach Ertz became the monster that he is. It's almost like Philly made him. Do you feel that way about Philly and you?

22 (2h 5m 31s):
Yeah, no, I feel like it's a town where you really have to earn your keep year to year. And I feel like just the fan base, the amount of tension that is on football, it makes players kind of play to their best ability. You know you're always being watched. But no, it's, it's been fun, a learning experience. You, I remember first getting drafted how intimidating it was. You know and just You know the notable seasons that they had. So, but yeah, man, this is home now. I mean, I, I love it and there's really no place like it. I mean, it's kinda like Texas when it comes to just intensity. But I mean, you're forever, forever loved around here. So it's mutual.

1 (2h 6m 5s):
Yeah. Well, you're world

22 (2h 6m 7s):
Champion Hell. yeah, that helps.

1 (2h 6m 8s):
Colin's got a question for you,

2 (2h 6m 9s):
Elaine. Has this been the greatest off season in the history of your career and possibly every offensive lineman because Aaron Donald is no longer playing in the NFL or is that, Hey

22 (2h 6m 19s):
Man, that

1 (2h 6m 20s):
Congrats

22 (2h 6m 21s):
On a great career, man. Yeah, yeah.

1 (2h 6m 22s):
Am way to go. Could have retired years ago is what? Every offensive

22 (2h 6m 25s):
Lineman. I mean, every, every NFL club hired a team psychiatrist because Hayden, he was the main guy bringing them in.

1 (2h 6m 34s):
Is there any other guys d line across the league that, ah,

22 (2h 6m 38s):
Man, they are, I mean Miles, Micah, tj, Nick, I mean all those, I mean just Max Crosby. I just feel like the guys that we have in the league, there's a lot of well-rounded guys and are each a little bit different. Like, you know, you look at Max Little kind of like t Jared Allen a little bit, just that's

1 (2h 6m 55s):
His white, yeah.

22 (2h 6m 56s):
Right? He's white. No, just Ben. Like his, his amount of Ben for a white dude seen and his

1 (2h 7m 0s):
Work ethic.

22 (2h 7m 1s):
Work ethic and his swag. You know he's bringing it back Bunch pal. First one

1 (2h 7m 4s):
In light, last one out. Hard

6 (2h 7m 6s):
Guy

1 (2h 7m 7s):
Probably ride a horse if you had to. Sure,

22 (2h 7m 9s):
Yeah. Spear and Elk. Did you see that? Yeah.

1 (2h 7m 11s):
Yep. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Max could do that if he had to. AJ's got one free lane.

6 (2h 7m 16s):
What's it like with Jalen Hurts at the helm when we see him, he seems like this handsome dude that has everything. It's all like, everything seems perfect. He has, he always says the right thing. He seems to be like the consummate leader in what you guys are doing. Like what's he like as a qb, not only on the field, but off the field.

22 (2h 7m 31s):
Friday night Lights. You remember Preacher Man, the demons man that didn't say a lot. Yes. Ivory. Yeah, ivory Christian. Yeah, he's like him a little bit more vocal, but still same like we have work to be done. We're not finished yet. But no, I, I mean, I kinda like that. I, I respect just how he approaches day to day is he's in there grinding, he's lifting, he's strong. It's like, Hey man, you got my respect. And then I just think from an oline perspective, he helps us out being able to escape leg, you know what I'm saying? It's, it's what guys are looking for. Now.

1 (2h 8m 1s):
Are you more jacked than you've ever been? Or you feel you

22 (2h 8m 4s):
I, man, I, I lost probably 15 pounds, so trying to lose the

1 (2h 8m 7s):
Fluff. Why? Why? Oh,

22 (2h 8m 8s):
Because we had to take our shirts off. It would look better. So

1 (2h 8m 11s):
Oh, so you lost 15 pounds for mania?

22 (2h 8m 13s):
Yeah. Well,

1 (2h 8m 14s):
Thank you. Thank you. You, you back mania shape.

22 (2h 8m 17s):
That's mania baby. Well, I knew, I knew about it for two weeks. So I had two weeks to just kind of cut the cobs out and lose the, the QB jacket.

1 (2h 8m 24s):
What'd you do immediately afterwards? Oh

22 (2h 8m 25s):
Fuck it was, yeah, I had a night last night. Yeah.

1 (2h 8m 28s):
Yeah, I bet you could. I'm

22 (2h 8m 29s):

22 (2h 8m 52s):
So what happened? Did you miss a concert or did you have somebody go get them tickets? Yeah,

1 (2h 8m 55s):
Somebody hopped in a helicopter, walked back out there saying, I'm flying out to the desert for nothing. What are we talking about? Hey, hey. I had to sit at a local bar for like four hours as this helicopter goes back to get our tickets. Comes all the way back. Real banged up.

So he is out in LA and so yeah man, I just, as I started getting banged up, I was like, I didn't take, I mean I always worked out, but just like being regimented, keeping, you know, I think Tom Brady convinced a lot of guys to, you know, sure.

Hey this is the first time I gotta to see AJ since like my rookie year. I remember pulling, I don't know if it was a power and I teed off and he just flat backed me. So if we get a chance, split that

1 (2h 10m 46s):
Clip. No, I remember, here we go. No, I was

22 (2h 10m 48s):
Coming off a T block. There we go. I stood up high and AJ just, I don't know if it's out there, but if you get a chance to look it up. Hey,

1 (2h 10m 54s):

Tired. Exactly. Yeah.

1 (2h 11m 21s):
How was that? You've kind of evolved through, I mean you've been through a lot of different football here.

22 (2h 11m 25s):
Yeah, I, I think the cool thing about it is just seeing all these players obviously in different eras. Like I got to see You know the OGs when I came in and now just You know the faces of the NFL changing and So I think just being a part of all that and then, yeah, now being an older guy, you just kind of be more wary of You know how you present yourself in the building. You have a lot of young guys looking, so

1 (2h 11m 46s):
Gotta be sinned up though. It looks like.

22 (2h 11m 47s):
Yeah, you gotta be zenned up, you gotta be focused and you gotta have You. know what I'm saying? You gotta, you gotta be dialed in so that's,

1 (2h 11m 53s):
And you gotta be off sides of

22 (2h 11m 55s):
Course you gotta be off sides and, and you gotta be consistent with it. And

Wrapping up on this solar eclipse of the heart Monday. One man that could tell us what the hell is going on ladies and gentlemen, he's Italian and he almost reads the Doppler as good as Joan and Ardo. Rest in peace ladies and gentlemen from the Weather channel. Jim Cantor.

24 (2h 14m 31s):
Yeah. Hey, what's going on guys?

1 (2h 14m 34s):
Holy shit Jim. What a day. How

24 (2h 14m 36s):
Are,

1 (2h 14m 36s):
What a day? How are you doing? You look amazing. Your goggles are a little bit different than ours. Are you? What? What the hell do you have going on there? Are those the fish?

24 (2h 14m 44s):
Jim, you know what these are?

1 (2h 14m 45s):
Ah, take

24 (2h 14m 46s):
A guess. Anybody know somebody guess from Oppenheimer? Take a look.

1 (2h 14m 49s):
Welder for

24 (2h 14m 50s):
Welding welder's glasses. Yeah, yeah, me dinging. You can use these. You can use these. They're welder glasses. Absolutely. Okay.

1 (2h 14m 57s):
Yeah, they looks fantastic. Yeah because if you're getting with the tag or the Omega Oro weld and you're doing, there's gonna be fire. Is that why we can't look up at it directly? Right. Because it's basically the power of the entire sun going into our eyeballs. Yes. What is the significance of this exactly? And this is a once in a lifetime. What do we have going on here today, Jim? Why do we need to respect this more than any other eclipse that we see?

24 (2h 15m 19s):
Well, you just get to study so more of the sun and the fact that you have so much sunspot activity means that scientists can go up there and they can look at that Corona, which we've seen already at Maslo. Alright. If you see it come into the United States, now we're looking at Russellville, Kansas getting ready to go into Russellville, Arkansas, getting ready to go into totality. Then it's Carbondale. Then we'll get it up here in, you guys gotta put, you know, get outside and check this thing out. But look at the Speedway, look at this place.

1 (2h 15m 45s):
Yeah. 50,000 str. Okay, I like that. What is that? That sounds that

24 (2h 15m 51s):
Look at that trophy right there.

1 (2h 15m 52s):
Yeah. That that's now they running today. All ni trophy right there, there. It's obviously for the Indy 500 champion. We have a live shot right now, I believe from Texas. I believe it's down in Texas right now. It is? Okay. Yep. There it is. That's, that's it. It's Eclipse. Wow.

24 (2h 16m 9s):
That's building.

1 (2h 16m 11s):
Okay. Yeah, so, so there, go

24 (2h 16m 13s):
Ahead. So they're in totality.

1 (2h 16m 14s):
Okay. Jim Indianapolis is the spot. We've been hearing about it for like the last two weeks as Indianapolis natives. Is it just because of like it's gonna perfectly line up in India or why is indie the epicenter?

24 (2h 16m 27s):
Yeah, well it's one of the, it's one of the Synthes in the path of totality. Okay, look at that man you just watched, see daily speeds, diamond ring and boom, now you're into totality. Wow, that is awesome. And. of course from that you can see the Corona around the sun and that's what the signs are trying to study. but you know, basically from where we're lined up our weather channel teams from Fredericksburg to Dallas to Little Rock to Carbondale, Tokyo, you know, Russellville, Arkansas as we talked about, which is where it is now, up to Indy, Buffalo, Cleveland, Holt and Maine, which should have the best viewing simply because of the bad guys that they're gonna have the blue sky after that big snow storm they had the other day. So we've got a little high clouding through here, but we're still gonna see a hole heck of block.

24 (2h 17m 9s):
This is just awesome. You, you talked about a pump up

1 (2h 17m 12s):
Baby Hell. yeah, Hell. yeah. Jim we're pumped up about solar eclipse as well. I didn't Why is, why is NASA launching? Why is NASA launching rockets up in the sky while this is taking place? Jim, him

24 (2h 17m 25s):
They want see that it's happening with the atmosphere when you block out the sun. We just don't get to do that that often.

1 (2h 17m 31s):
Right. Oh

24 (2h 17m 32s):
And so that's what they're doing And I mean look at this Corona, look at this thing and I'm learning a lot here. We have astrophysicist with us. Say that was three times fast. Seems Dr. Paul Suter and he's saying Jim, we just don't get a chance to look at the Corona like this. Especially when you have a total solar eclipse with a lot of sunspot activity. And that's what we've got so far. Amazing.

1 (2h 17m 53s):
It looks like the sun has a WWE entrance rate. It does. you know it kind put a little little curtain in front of it all as it makes its big debut on the other side. Jim, enjoy the hell out of Indianapolis. We appreciate your big break. Thanks brother. Hey, is the world gonna end? Jim? Is the world gonna end?

24 (2h 18m 9s):
No, the world's not gonna end just during the weather channel. We're following this thing all the way to Maine.

1 (2h 18m 13s):
Alright, world's not ending. That's good news ladies job Jim. K. World's

24 (2h 18m 20s):
Not ending. Yeah, we're good. I

2 (2h 18m 21s):
Mean you could see why that's awesome. Back in the day people would look up at the sky and think the world is ending though looking at that sun.

1 (2h 18m 27s):
I was thinking about like the first time this happened. Bingo. How about the first time like thunderstorm happened in the mid boom. How about in the Midwest where the sun leaves for five months? Yeah. They had to be like, oh we're dead. We're dead. The sun's never coming back. This is how this is gonna go. Excited for today. Obviously the solar eclipse which is making its way across the country now look up in the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane. No, it's the moon and the sun at the same damn time. What a day. Jim. Cantore, thank you for making time with your welding glasses on. Big shout out to the American nightmare. Cody Rhodes absolutely for coming by here. Big shout out to John Cena for stopping by here. Big shout out to awesome truth for stopping by here.

1 (2h 19m 37s):
Unbelievable. Okay, welcome. Really cool. Welcome. Come back. You're welcome. Anytime. Thumb digs great work. Thank you brother. Being spineless and going to the winning side. Just thin the last 48 hours of the Cody story, you got to experience the highest of highs. That has to feel pretty good. Yeah.

4 (2h 19m 51s):
Spineless or you know a lot of people are saying just smart, you know, looking at a champion and no one a champion

1 (2h 19m 57s):
Official bet for tonight for the championship

4 (2h 19m 60s):
Yukon

1 (2h 20m 2s):
Okay, Yukon's second half, whatever it, it's, I assume

4 (2h 20m 5s):

1 (2h 20m 6s):
Around there. Okay, sweet. Official be now Toxic table. You boys are gonna be in WWE 2K 24 Whoa. Everybody here in WWE universe is pumped about. Oh yeah,

2 (2h 20m 16s):
Definitely.

1 (2h 20m 17s):
A lot of the people that have been walking around this particular, you know, WWE world have been tweeting nothing but positive things about you guys being in there. Yep. Connor, what'd you learn for your WWE 2K character this weekend that maybe you didn't know before?

2 (2h 20m 30s):
I learned, and I think this probably from awesome truth, that the road is long and the the road is hard. But in the end, when you have your moment and, and you can be the champion and you can, and when we do hoist those not only raw tag team titles, but also smack down tag team titles, right? That'll be worth it in the end. And then you gotta take it all in. But also seriously, you thank you for all this shit this entire weekend. It's cool to be able to actually sit behind you. Yeah and watch everything. Like we get to watch at home a lot of the times and like that's one thing but to like be a part of it. 'cause the crowd like you always say, is a part of the match to be able to be a part of a WrestleMania.

2 (2h 21m 10s):
Especially the biggest of all time. Like, thank you for having us here.

1 (2h 21m 13s):
Hey, no problem. We're lucky to be here. Lucky to be here. Ty. Obviously Roman reigns loses. This is a night in a weekend that we'll remember forever. How will you remember WrestleMania weekend that isn't done yet? Raw After Mania is still a part of the whole thing

3 (2h 21m 26s):
Not done yet as maybe one of the biggest John Cena marks of all time. I mean him coming up here on the stage and basically saying like, Hey listen. Yep, I got another chapter to write in this book. So. I Don't, I mean, I don't know. Next year at at Mania, are we gonna get Cody Rhodes versus Cena Main event? What? Whoa,

2 (2h 21m 44s):
I don't know. Chance.

3 (2h 21m 45s):
It's certainly possible, but no, yeah, like Connor said, like for watching it for so long to be able to, I mean shit during Cody and Roman, like they're literally right here. Like we're, we're watching them two inches away. Like you just growing up, you never think you'd have an opportunity to be in that situation. So this weekend is, I don't know, nostalgia and everything. It's just, it's the fucking best. It's awesome. Yep.

1 (2h 22m 9s):
I've lived the dumbest life of all time, the luckiest life of all time and I continued to try and enjoy literally every single second of it. It was really easy this weekend. Yeah, this weekend was awesome. Yeah, it was. Yeah. Thank you to the WWE for the hospitality and thank you to ESPN for setting this up. Thank you to all of you that watch that allow us to do this for a living. We're the luckiest humans on earth now. WrestleMania weekend wraps up tonight on USA network at 8:00 PM Eastern with the raw after mania, which is always fucking huge. Yep. So tonight should be absurd. Our lives are dumb, but we're very grateful.

1 (2h 22m 49s):
We'll See you tomorrow with an overreaction Tuesday. Ooh. To the men's national championship and also raw after mania. Be a friend, tell a friend something nice. It might change their life. We're in this thing together and I think this weekend has showcased the community of pro wrestling is how everywhere should be. Yeah. We're a community team on me. Team on three. 1, 2, 3.
