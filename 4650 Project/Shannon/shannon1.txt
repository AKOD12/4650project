Alright, Ojo, check this out. It's time for a cap cap. Dak not trying to be the highest paid quarterback in his next contract. Let's take a listen to what Dak had to say in regards to his next contract.

8 (3m 26s):
Yeah, no, I'm not trying to be the highest paid necessarily, so I, I'll wait till negotiations began and, and obviously wanna put this team in the best situation. So

9 (3m 40s):
Have your feelings changed at all about your desire to be wanting to be in Dallas past 2025?

8 (3m 45s):
No, I'm, I'm focused on, on, on here right now where I am. It's always how I've been. You can, anytime y'all asked me, it's always been about right now getting better tomorrow. And I've been in this situation before, so it's okay. I'm fine in in any, in, in any situation at that point. Betting on myself or playing this year out and

10 (4m 7s):
Yeah. Key words, key words I heard from that. Betting on myself. I like that. Betting on myself. Listen, if I'm Dak Yeah. If I'm Dak Dak, I know you gonna see this. I love you baby. I'll let your boy anyway. If I was you, I would take the Kirk Cousins route and bet on myself. That's something Kirk has been doing for how long, when he was with Washington, when he was with the commanders. What'd he do? Hey.

3 (4m 30s):
Yeah, he got two, he got two franchise. Right. I

10 (4m 32s):
I understand that. But also I'm bett on

3 (4m 34s):
Franchise tax. Went to Minnesota, got three years fully guaranteed. You know what? Then got another three year fully

10 (4m 42s):
Ed. This is this last year. Right? It, you know, you know what I would do, honestly? Yeah.

3 (4m 47s):
This last

10 (4m 47s):
Start, I don't even want no deal. I wouldn't even want no deal. I'm going to bet on myself because listen, it don't take all this time for no other quarterbacks when it's time to get paid and understanding what you have, there are no other options right now for the Cowboys. You, he is the fu is he the future or is he not? There's nothing to be negotiating about. The numbers are the numbers. The market is the market. It ain't shit to talk about. So that's how y'all feel. Is that how y'all feel? We, we, we wanna prolong everything. You know what if I was Dak right? I say, you know what, I'll tell my agent, but don't worry about it. I'm finna bet on myself. And after the season, man, go ahead and break the bank somewhere.

10 (5m 30s):
Go ahead and break the bank. I know you wanna say all the right things. I don't want to be the highest paid. I understand what you mean. Listen, everything you're gonna say right now is politically correct. I'm just saying what I would do And, I would like you to do, right? I would like you to say, you know what, I'm not gonna play the game that they wanna play over at Jerry's World. I'm gonna play my last contract out, play the season out, and go elsewhere and break the bank. I,

3 (6m 1s):
For me, I get what you're saying, Ocho it all depends on how close to the number that I, I can tolerate. Let's just say Ocho, I want $50 million a year. I want, Hey, hey, they say, you know what Shannon, okay Ocho you want 50 million a year, five year deal, we can only get to 46. So tell me what can't you do with 230 million doing?

10 (6m 29s):
Right. I like, I like that you can

3 (6m 30s):
Do what?

10 (6m 31s):
That you make sense when you put it like that, you make sense

3 (6m 35s):
Because if you blow, if you, if you blow two 50, you gonna blow two 30. Oh yeah. If you blow two 30, you go blow two 50. So that's, that's the thing. How close of the number can they get to that? I can say, you know what, I can live with it. 'cause they even swap Ain't no swindle. Both people gotta feel like they getting screwed. Right, right, right. In order, in order for it to be a good deal, Ocho. Because if you feel like if, if the team feel like you got over them, they're gonna have resentment. Resentment. If you feel the team got over on you, you are gonna have resentment. So both teams, both parties need to feel like they got screwed over in order for it to be like, damn, he got me.

3 (7m 18s):
God dang it, man, they got me, man.

10 (7m 20s):
Damn. I don't know. I just, I just don't like the way they play you. You know, IIII love, IIII love the game of football. I love the Dallas Cowboys. I love the Dallas fans. Yeah. I love the, that the players that are in Dallas, I just don't like the way it's run as a circus by the individual. Who is the ringleader? That, that's all And, I mean. No disrespect by that. And especially when it comes to, when it comes to the posi the the quarterback position. There's one thing you don't do is you don't play with them. You make sure you take care of them first, so there's no uncertainty. And so they know that they're all in on you as the future and the quarterback of that team.

10 (8m 4s):
I mean, man, don't, don't get mad. They playing, they playing games. Man,

3 (8m 9s):
Man. See the, the pro ocho here's the problem that I have is that everybody holds back for me. And you know, hey look, I I, I don't pull any punches. I hold everybody accountable. But you know, it seems to be that, oh, people over here, what I heard, I hold certain people accountable. You can't say, well, paying Dak all that money and it hadn't won of anything. Ain't you played a lot of quarterbacks, a lot of money. So if you really look at, in that term, the only person that deserved to be paid then is Patrick Mahomes. Right? So if we're just looking at quarterbacks paid and that have won something, right? Only Patrick Mahomes is deserving of that. So you can't say, well, we paid Dak all that money.

3 (8m 49s):
He ain't won nothing, man. They done paid Kirk cousin the trillion dollars

10 (8m 54s):
Money. Yeah,

3 (8m 54s):
They paid, they paid Josh Allen. Right? A ton of money. They played a lot of quarterbacks. So that, that's, that's my only argument. And yeah. Come, come with you won Big buck, come big expectations. There's a reason why CEOs make the money they make because they have a harder job than everybody else. So the quarterback has a more difficult job. You could understand why he makes the most, I'm not saying I'm not, now look, I'm not saying just because he's the quarterback he should make, if he terrible, he should make more than a quarterback that's better than him or he shouldn't make more than a defensive lineman on offensive lineman. But I'm saying in this situation, I think everybody in the chat understand what we're talking about.

3 (9m 38s):
We're talking about these elite level quarterbacks. And, and look, whether you think Dak is elite or not, he's paid like an elite level quarterback. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we throw that term elite around too loosely. Because I remember when I got Elite 80, they wasn't talking about that. A guy, a guy, you know, won four or five games in a row. Wasn't nobody shouting Elite, right? Wasn't nobody shouting Elite. You know, you have a handful of guys. You had the Elways, you had the Montanas, you had the Marinos. There was a handful of guys that got that label. Elite now Guy, Hey guy, win 10 games. He Elite,

10 (10m 14s):
Huh?

3 (10m 17s):
So with no Pro Bowls, no MVPs, no suit. That's all. Okay. Yeah. That's how

10 (10m 23s):
Y'all Hey. I mean the criteria changes.

3 (10m 24s):
Everybody's got their own

10 (10m 25s):
Criteria. Know who you're asking and who the player is being talked about. But again, when it comes to Dak, if I was you, yeah, I'm betting on myself. I'm betting on myself. You know what? I ain't even worried. You know what? Forget negotiations. I'm going in this year just fo focus on, focus on CD Lamb. Focus on

3 (10m 43s):
Cd, lamb, Joe, they came to you right up and

10 (10m 44s):
Focus on Michael Parsons.

3 (10m 48s):
They got five O Joe, they got five years, $230 million right now with a hundred with a, with 120 full guarantee.

10 (10m 55s):
You know what? Hold on, hold on. Say

3 (10m 56s):
Five years, I'm gonna bet on myself.

10 (10m 58s):
Let's, let's give Dak, let, let's, let's give Dak three. Let's give Dak 3, 2 50 with a, with a hundred. With 130 guaranteed.

3 (11m 10s):
Bro, they not giving no Dak no. $82 million a year. You out your damn mind.

10 (11m 15s):
I ain't think that went through. Hey, I'm just trying. Hey listen, I'm, I'm, I'm, Hey, I'm, I'm trying to get my dog as much money

3 (11m 22s):
As possible.

10 (11m 22s):
Two 50. I'm just, Hey, listen, from my mouth to God is,

3 (11m 30s):
Hey Ocho, you do Ocho you do realize Yeah, 46 million over five years.

10 (11m 39s):
Yeah. I, I I like it. Just don't think, you know. No, I, oh, you gonna

3 (11m 46s):
Say I'll bet on Myself's enough money for

10 (11m 48s):
Dak, And

3 (11m 49s):
I won't you a year?

10 (11m 51s):
I don't think it's enough money for Dak, because why? There isn't an amount of money that Dak can be paid from Jerry Jones based on the type of shit he got to deal with with that organization. What he got deal with, with that owner always in front of the camera. All the unwanted, all the unneeded pressure coming from the owner. He needs every bit of dollar based on what he has to deal with when he's under that umbrella. Everything that has to do with the Dallas Cowboys and that star, he needs to be con he needs to be compensated as such. You the book, you need therapy to play for the Cowboys. You need counseling to play for the cowboys. The fans need counseling and therapy because they always, always are promised things and it never happens.

3 (12m 39s):
No, I need therapy for dealing with 'em. This our year. They win two or three games. They be all in the chat. We done, boy, how you like us now? You ain't talking now. Oh, what you say? I say see. Okay. Just give it time. Just give it time. You already know what's gonna happen. You, you, you already know And I See this year different. Yeah. Even on, even on the, the network I'm on. Oh, this year just seems different. They're more complete team. You say this every year. I've seen 'em when they've had 12 pro bowlers. I've seen it when they've had the All pros at this. I mean, think about it. They had an all pro guard or guard a all pro two all pro guard. A all pro tackle, all pro wide receiver, all pro quarterback, all pro, all pro quarterback.

3 (13m 22s):
Yeah.

10 (13m 24s):
What,

3 (13m 24s):
How much more

10 (13m 25s):
You got, how much more people say, people love to say o Dak is overrated. Or people love to say Dak isn't worth this. Well, tell me the quarterbacks that are look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at the landscape of the league.

3 (13m 39s):
What you, you worth? What somebody's willing to pay. Look

10 (13m 40s):
At the quarterbacks and continuously winning year in a year out. And tell me why Dak is not worthy. Because only one team win the Super Bowl at the end of the year. Only one team. Only one team. And they're very, there's a small amount of quarterbacks that have their team to contention year in, year out. A a very small amount. So tell me why Dak is not worthy. Because there's nobody else that you can take from another team and put 'em on the Cowboys. I'm not talking about, I'm talking about not not, I'm not talking about the main starters. You, you're not moving Patrick. You're not moving Patrick Mahome. You're not moving Josh Allen not moving. Lamar Jackson. You're not, you're not removing Josh Allen.

10 (14m 21s):
You, you, you know what I mean? So tell guys,

3 (14m 24s):
Tell

10 (14m 24s):
Would pick and put him in the cowboys position at the quarterback position and you would still get the same results.

3 (14m 36s):
See, here's the thing though, coach Joe, and what we have to be careful of is saying worth because how many times, like, man, that car ain't worth that. Well, somebody paid $3 million for that car, so clearly it was worth it, man, I wouldn't pay no 20 million, you know, 50 million for no house. House. Clearly somebody paid that for it. So it was worth it. Something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. You can say, I'm worth this all you want, but if nobody's willing to pay you that salary, you're not worth it. I know my worth. What is your worth? What is somebody willing to pay you for that? You hear that all the time? I know my value.

3 (15m 17s):
Yeah. Who determined? Okay, you, you gonna pay yourself.

10 (15m 20s):
Yeah.

3 (15m 21s):
So while you're doing all this, I know my worth. I know my value. If somebody doesn't pay you that I

10 (15m 26s):
Like that value. You said that because that's, that's another one. You're

3 (15m 29s):
Not worth it.

10 (15m 29s):
I'm off topic just a little bit. Women. Yeah. Look, women, women love that.

3 (15m 34s):
I know you women

10 (15m 35s):
Love that. I know my value. What is that value in general? That's a great topic for another day. We, we, we, we, yeah. Yeah. I'm the, I'm the, I'm

3 (15m 43s):
The, I'm the prize. I'm the prize. Well, lemme ask you a question, Don Joe, when they tell you I'm the prize, I'm the prize. Well, who the collector?

10 (15m 52s):
Come on. Come, come on prea.

3 (15m 55s):
Who won the prize, right? You keep telling me you the prize, but guess what? Right there. I see you still sitting on the shelf. Ain't nobody purchased it yet. Why you bumping your gums?

10 (16m 7s):
Right, right, right.

3 (16m 8s):
I mean, in order for it to be a prize, somebody has to be willing to win it. Right? Somebody has, you know, big cash. Come on, come on. Fantasy five on cash

10 (16m 15s):
Form. Yes sir.

3 (16m 17s):
You know, I mean, normally I'm playing like, okay, you the prize. Okay, so is anybody ever gonna win it or does anybody try to win it? Come on. But does anybody want it? Oh, because there are a lot of times they'll prize And. I don't even want that.

10 (16m 33s):
Yeah. Yeah. I I just, I just thought about, because I see it all the time. I Yeah, yeah. I, I see it all the time. And, I

3 (16m 40s):
Thought you would. I just

10 (16m 41s):
Like the wording. And then when you said, well, somebody has to be willing to pay what that value is, because you can't determine what the value is yourself. You can't do that. Yes. Okay. Right.

3 (16m 54s):
That, and that's what it look, I understand. And so me, this is what I like about what the platforms that we have, because we get determined our worth, but I got tired, right? Of being viewed as talent. Right. I take a check, I move it along, and within that scheme, I can only get what I'm entitled to, what I signed for. But in this, I can create as many shows as I possibly can that the viewing audience, that the listening audience like. Mm,

10 (17m 27s):
I like

3 (17m 28s):
It. And then I get to determine that worth. Because the more shows you have, the more shows people like, they're gonna view it, advertise, the sponsor's gonna come. So y'all need to stop talking about, oh, I'm worth this. Not if somebody won't buy you a Birkin. Right? Not if somebody won't buy you a house or a condo or a car, you, you not worth that. You only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. So I don't care because you hear that all the time, sir. I was at a guy's house, yeah, about six months ago, probably about six months ago. Probably conservative. Yeah. Having a conversation with him.

3 (18m 8s):
He walked in, he saw the house,

10 (18m 10s):
What?

3 (18m 11s):
80 million? 80, 80 million and got him up out of there. He said, don't take anything

10 (18m 20s):
80

3 (18m 24s):
80. Beautiful. Told me I could get it. Hey, hey told me I could get it for the weekend if I need it. I said, you know what I say, but man, ain't nobody, I ain't, she gotta be an angel. Sit down from the heavens above to come up in him. 80 million. I wouldn't even think about bringing somebody up in hit the button in the whole, the house goes into the floor, you overlook it. I can damn near see San Francisco.

10 (18m 56s):
That gotta be some hey,

3 (18m 58s):
Infinity, right? When Buzz, like you said, infinity and beyond, he talking about the pool on Infinity and beyond Olympic. There

10 (19m 7s):
Gotta be somebody in tech. Huh? They gotta be somebody in tech.

3 (19m 10s):
Man, stop it. Look here. All I all I heard, he say, if you need it, just let me gimme the heads up. Hey, you really listen, you don't

10 (19m 22s):
Do you know the kind of money you gotta be making behind an 80 million dollar house though? That, that's CEOs, that's the owner of something 80 million.

3 (19m 39s):
Tell told him to leave it as he that that's

10 (19m 41s):
Real sp too, that's that slick talk that hey, that's, that's that slick talk.

3 (19m 45s):
Just, just the on your

10 (19m 47s):
Back and redo it and, and redo everything. Anyway,

3 (19m 53s):
I like, man, please. Like, but so that, that's, that's what it, and, and you know, I heard a a, a guy had a bunch of money, he's probably worth probably 7 billion.

10 (20m 6s):
Oh yeah.

3 (20m 8s):
And to hear them talk the way they talk and he said, Shannon, I don't need any more money, but I don't need any less either. He says, I have something in this position that I'm in that most people will never have. I said, well, what's that? He said, enough.

10 (20m 33s):
Oh yeah.

3 (20m 34s):
When people say, I got that f you money. Yeah. When you start getting into the bill billion, you start getting 3 0 5, 6 50, a hundred. But at that point in time, what do you buy that you, I mean, if you spend a, if you spend a thousand dollars a day, if you started spending it before Christ, you couldn't spend it all in a lifetime. So at what point in time do you like, okay, I want a car. Okay, you got the most expensive car, now what? Well, I want a house over here, over there, over there. Then now what? You just run out of stuff to buy. So for me, like, that's what made me change, like worth, worth, worth.

3 (21m 14s):
And, I was, I was, I was a, I was a big proponent of that, man, I'm worth this or that person ain't worth that. Right.

10 (21m 19s):
They, they, they worth,

3 (21m 20s):
But somebody paid that person that so clearly they thought they was worth it. Just because I don't, that don't mean somebody else won't. Same way. Because you know, we all been that Ocho you ain't gonna find nobody a women. Don't y'all believe that? Don't y'all believe nobody A oh yeah. Ain't nobody ain't ain't whatever. Just like when y'all told me, ain't nobody gonna want me watch.

10 (21m 46s):
No. It's one thing

3 (21m 47s):
Comes and get me somebody,

10 (21m 49s):
Women, there will always be a man that's willing, there will always be a man that's willing to do what you want for. Now, you sure might not get everything you want depending on the type of man you want. but it will always be a man that is willing. Now you think you gonna get you one of these one percenters and you know, he gonna sweep you off your feet and you not gonna have to walk, you know, work a day in your life like they do in the movies. Nah, that ain't likely. That ain't, that ain't, that ain't that. That ain't likely. You gotta, you gotta be real.

3 (22m 17s):
You gotta be realistic. But

10 (22m 19s):
There's always, there will always be a man. Women love to say I deserve Yes you do. Yes you do, you do. You all of you deserve, but you also have to be realistic.

3 (22m 33s):
Yeah, but you gotta stop that. I, I deserve to be happy

10 (22m 35s):
That start that

3 (22m 36s):
From a man can't make you happy. Yeah.

10 (22m 37s):
That start from within. Yeah.

3 (22m 39s):
Yeah. Happiness is what you create. That ain't what you find. And they

10 (22m 41s):
Always equate happiness. Yeah. To the materialist possessions that they're able to receive every time. Shit. Oh yeah. My bad, my bad. I

3 (22m 55s):
Just heard off topic. Just I

10 (22m 57s):
Heard the word value. When you, when you bro, you talk about it just, it it, it triggers something. It just triggers something. So I just, Hey,

3 (23m 7s):
Y'all need to start with this foolishness talking about, oh, elite prize fighters don't care about belts. That's how you're judged.

10 (23m 13s):
They say elite prize fighters. I've, I've never heard belt. Yeah.

3 (23m 18s):
Don't care about

10 (23m 18s):
Fighter in general. Say that.

3 (23m 24s):
That's, you know what people say when people don't care about championships and stuff like that. Ain't never won nothing.

10 (23m 30s):
Yeah, but you, you,

3 (23m 31s):
They never won anything because what do you what that's like said that's like I'm a jockey. And I said, well, I don't care about winning the Kentucky Derby. I don't care about winning the previous or the Triple Crown or the Santa Anita. I don't care about winning the breeders cup. I mean mean, then what the hell you up jockey for

10 (23m 47s):
Chad? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the belts do matter because as, as you continue to attain, of course they do different belts, if I'm not mistaken. Doesn't that give you the leverage to command the kind of money you want? Yeah, I I, I, I thought that's how it works. So I'm not Yes,

3 (24m 6s):
Yes. A person that don't have no belts, don't get to, don't get to, don't get to control anything. Now maybe somebody says, you know what, I wanna take the fight just because,

10 (24m 16s):
Oh yeah,

3 (24m 17s):
But Floyd got everything that he wanted because he had the belts pick and choose. Canelo gets the fight. Who he wants

10 (24m 22s):
Man can, has the belt Canelo command 40 million at the gate. Yes. That's before pay-per-view, man.

3 (24m 32s):
So what guy that don't have a belt can command 40 million? Tell me the fighter that can command the purse that the, the granted now when Tyson got out, yeah,

10 (24m 42s):
But

3 (24m 42s):
There's only been one Mike Tyson,

10 (24m 46s):
There's

3 (24m 47s):
Only been one here

10 (24m 48s):
40 million out the gate. That's before pay-per-view.

3 (24m 53s):
So without a bell infighting, how can you, there's a reason why now look in most sports, now you get outliers like Connor McGregor and the, and, but Connor say, if you think about all the guys, because nor normally it takes a, it takes a person that, that became a fighter kind of down on their look, kind of down trodden. You had the hard upbringing. It's like, yeah, I wanna make a way, but I wanna be a champion. That's how you remembered

10 (25m 24s):
A champion.

3 (25m 27s):
That's why they have belts. If belt didn't matter, they wouldn't have one, would it? Think about it. Name something that you compete in. That's a sport that you don't get to get a trophy or a belt. Cornhole. They give you a belt, you win, you win a a, a formula one, they give you something. So now all of a sudden the highest prize that's in your sport, it don't matter. They

10 (25m 46s):
Just, they just talking.

3 (25m 47s):
See, that just goes to show you.

10 (25m 48s):
They just, they just talking

3 (25m 50s):
Pe people. I'm just glad, hopefully I've never played with people like that. Because I remember when I used to train, when I would go back home and guys was like, man, what you train that? I would tell 'em what time you travel. I would tell them and they didn't show up. I'm like, they ain't on my team. I don't care.

10 (26m 8s):
Right.

3 (26m 10s):
I'm tell you what I'm doing. I'm running myself into exhaustion. Oh man. Do you, Hey, how many you got today? We got 20. We got 2110s, or we got 15. One 50, or we got jumbos. Three folds. Three threes days. 3, 2, 3, 1, 50, 300. Oh man. Hey, I'm gonna finish mine. Oh. Oh. So I finished, I finished, I, we, I won. Okay. Today we got 30. I did 31 tens. I did the, I did the last 10 by myself. Everybody

10 (26m 42s):
Called you was on time too, right? Yeah.

3 (26m 48s):
Oh. Oh,

10 (26m 49s):
How many, how many, how many minutes You rested me between, do you remember or No,

3 (26m 55s):
45. I started out, I started out with 45 and then the last 10. Oh

10 (27m 2s):
Yeah, yeah,

3 (27m 3s):
Yeah. That last 10. That's dope. I needed a minute. That's

10 (27m 6s):
Good. That's good condition right there. That

3 (27m 8s):
Thing come quick because see, that's ocho. Yeah. Because discipline requires you to do your very best when no one else is watching. I'm gone. When they left, I could have like, hell, ain't nobody else out here. I could've just told 'em I did it, but I would've known. And so now I'm late in the third or the fourth quarter. I'm wondering why I can't dig down and get it. Don't be mad at the results you didn't get for the work you didn't put in. See, that's what people do. Yeah. I don't know why. Cutting corner. What about that work

10 (27m 40s):
Cutting corners.

3 (27m 41s):
Did you put the work in? Did you put the time in? Did you put the energy in? Did you put the effort in? Nothing everybody wants, wants something for nothing. Everybody want to go to heaven. Ocho nobody wants dead. Now. The Bible teaches us, you can't come in here unless you go through that process. So now I ask you this. When you write down your goals, and everybody normally write down goals. Now do you write, so in the left column, you are writing down your goals in the right column. Do you write down what you're willing to sacrifice to get it

10 (28m 19s):
Right?

3 (28m 20s):
See, everybody will tell you what they want, but who would tell you what they'll do to get it? Oh, I wouldn't do that. You, you don't deserve it.

10 (28m 28s):
You don't want it bad enough.

3 (28m 29s):
You see, you haven't earned it. Everybody writes down their goals in the left, but in the right column, do you write down what you're willing to sacrifice to get it? No. And then when you don't, well, he messed over me or they don't like me on the job. Or this happened. Or that happened. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You one of those everything you the, you have to be the most un luckiest person in the world because from the time you was three years old, you gave me excuse for why. But can you gimme one reason? Why not?

3 (29m 10s):
No, man, stop it. Y'all been, that's, that's the problem. Oh, Joe, everybody see for me, man. Why you?

10 (29m 19s):
Yeah,

3 (29m 20s):
Because I want to be the best. I don't think me, I'm better than anybody than I think I'm better at what I do because I know what I'm willing to do to get, I know the sacrifices. And I ain't got no problem. And everybody that's in my life understands it. And if you don't, oh well, life. Okay,

10 (29m 49s):
I like it.

3 (29m 53s):
People don't want that. Oh, people don't want you to tell, people want you to tell 'em a warm, fuzzy story. But you know, you did that. No, no, no, bro, no. Shannon watched your grandparents sacrifice until you know, my grandfather. You know, my grandfather was feeling, feeling, man, Ocho, you know how you, you, I used to get free lunch, but my grandfather all of a sudden he wanted to feel big and bad. He ain't want be, Hey, we, we ain't gonna get no free lunch, man. That man like to star me, Ocho Man. Right? Them 50 cent, you had a 50 cent a day, people like 50. Yeah, man, 50 cent was a lot of damn money back in the seventies, because think about it.

3 (30m 36s):
50 cent a day. Yeah. Five days a week. That's $2 50 cents. Me, my brother and sister, that's seven 50 a week times four weeks. Man. Hey, you better put down there. Hey, we ain't got no money. Lemme get, man, lemme get you free. And lemme play a nickel for, for chocolate, extra chocolate milk. Come on man. You about me in here, man, please. But that's what I, oh, Joe. When I, a lot of times, like when I do fi fireside chat or I do public speaking, that's what I, I And I, And I tell people, and And I said, okay, when you wanted to achieve something, you says, I want to do this.

3 (31m 30s):
But on the other side, did you write down, this is what I'm willing to do to get it. That's called a sacrifice. And the greater the goal, the greater the sacrifice.

10 (31m 40s):
Yeah. Always.

3 (31m 44s):
And nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm. I go to work every day now one time, John every to ask me all the time, he like, t how you come to work happy every day? I've never seen you in a bad mood. Same thing at CBS. Same thing at Fox. I was like, bro, do you understand? I dreamt, I laid in that bed, that iron ass bed getting rained on, dreaming of this moment. I'm here. I get to live out my dreams. I get to take care of my family beyond anything I could even imagine, man.

3 (32m 25s):
Please. Yeah. What is that'll be sad about Ocho

11 (32m 32s):
Man. Please.

Patrick Mahome has passed on hosting Saturday Night Live outta fear. After declining, after declining a chance to host Mahomes. Reveal why he didn't feel ready to accept. I have a little bit, a little bit of fear of the teleprompter. Mahomes was still scared from a bad experience that he suffered at the S piece. It's not easy because that's not, yeah, it repetition. And I

10 (35m 38s):
School.

3 (35m 39s):
You know, when I went to CBS, which I have a very collo, heavy colloquial dialect. If you listen to my brother talk, right? You listen to me talk, you wouldn't know we were brothers, right? 'cause they're like, how can two people raised in the same house speak so differently? And so I went, had And, I was getting going. The lady was coming down from Philadelphia, working with me every other weekend when I was in New York. Went out to Dallas and talked to people. Speech, a lot of speeches, cadence, a lot of speeches. Like they give you kick right, kick sick rick, stuff like that. A lot of alliterations better by a Buick buddy to get you to enunciate,

10 (36m 21s):
To

3 (36m 21s):
Right Speak enunciate your words. My problem is, is that I go fast and when I go fast, my voice rises. So now you hear the high pitch. Look at, look at, she got a, she got a T-shirt. She got a sweatshirt over my eyes, because that's how I am. When I get excited, my voice rises. Now, like when I'm just like talking to you, I have a very, very, a very deep voice. But as I get excited, my voice rises. And then it's hard for me to enunciate words. It's hard for me for people to understand. And so, man, man, I'm watching inside the NBA and I'm looking at Charles Barkley talk.

3 (37m 9s):
I'm like,

10 (37m 10s):
Right.

3 (37m 11s):
He butcher words worse than I do, man. Please, lemme go. I'm done. I ain't going to no more therapy. I ain't gonna no more nothing. Yeah. This is who I'm,

10 (37m 21s):
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I mess up every blue moment. But you

3 (37m 23s):
See what you get Ocho

10 (37m 24s):
No, it's funny, depending on what show I'm on Or what camera I'm on, I, I I I, I flip the script really quick and change the way I talk really fast or when I'm on here, right? I can just be my goddamn self and, and then Right. And say, and say what I wanna say. But hey, inside the NFL, you know, I'm gonna change it up really quick and talk as professional as possible. And I, one of the things I have to work on that I have a problem with Yes. Is I talk so damn fast. I talk so fast. And because I'm talking so fast, I'm not thinking out what I wanna say. I'm just letting it go. And it's just running off And I. Sometimes I mispronounce words. I say it wrong. Yeah. Because I, I ne I never slow down.

10 (38m 5s):
Yeah. I never slow. I have to, I have to slow down. I need to take classes myself. Right?

3 (38m 13s):
Well, that's the thing, when you read the prompter, right, the first thing they tell you is that you have more time than you think. And. I always, anytime that I do ad reads or I have to do something in prompter, right? I have to always tell myself, Shana, you got more time than you think. You got more time than you think. You got more time than you think. And so I go through it a couple of times. I read it four or five times, you know? And then you get a cadence of it. Because you have to realize, like when, like Patrick Mahomes, that prompter is at the back of the room and it's, it's big now. It's big, but it's still at the back of the room. Now, normally when you reading ain't nothing moving just your eyes. But now as you read that prompter, that prompter's moving and what you wanna do, you feel you need to speed up also.

3 (38m 59s):
So that was the problem that I was running into. So for me, I'm like, Hey bro, I, hey, I try to do as little prompter right as I, as I have, as I, as I can. But here, you know what, I have ad reads, I have ad read for club Shaha. I have stuff that I have to do. But, and then you're like, okay, you tell yourself, okay, you got more time than you think. Make, you know, I come in here early, I read through it, get the cadence of it. Okay. Yeah.

10 (39m 27s):
I, I,

3 (39m 27s):
But it not, it's prompter. It's not easy.

10 (39m 31s):
As opposed to looking at a script and having to memorize it and just say it in my words. I prefer having a prompter with the, with the script in there where it sounds like me, as opposed to just seeing it on paper and trying to memorize it, then regurgitating it out. And I mean, when I think about Mahomes and being on SNL, I don't, I don't, I don't think that's really not his personality. That that's, that's that's it. Just, it, it doesn't fit. You know, him and who he is. Yeah. Especially right now, I think, I think it's too early for him. And it, it would almost be having to force him to do something that he's uncomfortable with in general, outside of just the prompter. Just, just the, the way he is, the way he carries himself. SNL is really not, not him now.

10 (40m 12s):
Peyton, Peyton Manning, that's him. Travis Kel, that's him. It fits their persona.

3 (40m 19s):
But see in that, but that's what you, but see, here's the thing though. See what you just said. That's what you compare it against. Yeah.

10 (40m 26s):
Yeah.

3 (40m 26s):
Guys that have done it and have been great at it. See, I don't like to do things. Most guys that are great at things don't like to do things they're not great at.

10 (40m 35s):
Yeah.

3 (40m 36s):
Patrick Mahomes is here. You mean to tell me all of a sudden just reading something in a little monitor, right? Yeah. No, I'm not good at that, bro. So I ain't doing it. See me, I don't like, I don't like prompter because I just move. See, I just like for the, this is easy for me. I'm very, very, I'm just look directly into the camera, camera. Find me. I'm talking, I'm having a conversation. So when I'm at a podium, I'm just having a conversation. I'm talking to somebody, I look out in the crowd, I'm move up and down. But I'm not, I'm not really looking into it. I'm not, unless I have something directly to say that. Well, Kate Ocho, I'm talking directly to you.

3 (41m 18s):
Or if I'm looking, I'm talking directly, but for the most part, camera follow me. I'm having a conversation. We're in the barber shop. I mean, we we're in the barber shop and we talking to people, we ain't looking directly at that person. We talking,

10 (41m 33s):
Yo,

3 (41m 35s):
Check this out. ocho, Jim Brent Beach said is the latest member of the chief to back Caius Tony Beach said Caius Tony problem. He is our most talented, is probably our most talented wire out. Says it's just a matter of him staying healthy. And I. Don't think we've ever stopped believing in it.

10 (41m 49s):
You know, you know how Listen, you know you don't pay that any attention.

3 (41m 56s):
Keep, we gotta keep, keep his value just in case.

10 (41m 59s):
All the game, it's all smoke mirrors. Bunch of bullshit, obviously. But he did say something, right? Kaaris Tony and being the most skilled receiver that they do have. Yes. Yes. He is. If, if when he's healthy and when he's used correctly, he is dynamic. He's special. Just, things just didn't work out. Obviously they're trying to keep his value up. Huh?

3 (42m 20s):
Concentration ojo. He don't, he got because Ojo, okay, I can run the perfect route.

10 (42m 25s):
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

3 (42m 26s):
And he's a tremendous route runner. Yeah, you right. But what good is a great route. If I drop the ball, that's

10 (42m 31s):
Something he could,

3 (42m 33s):
If I'm shooting, if I'm shooting, oh, so me and you playing basketball, right? Okay. I need to box you out to get the rebound. The possession doesn't, don't, doesn't start until I grab the rebound. Right. What if you missed a shot? And I don't get the rebound. What have I done? You run that great route. Yeah.

10 (42m 48s):
That's something he could work on. And then you, the ball, I'm listen to, he's, he's gonna be somewhere else and he, he needs a fresh start. He needs a fresh start to get things going. Now, I'm not sure what the Rashid Rice, Rashid rice situation is like now. I think they might keep him based on the situation and not knowing what's going to happen with him. I mean, I know he is not going nowhere, but I'm sure Oh, he ain't nowhere have to, might have to sit a little bit based on Yeah,

3 (43m 15s):
Yeah, I did. Prob probably, that's probably, he probably missed a couple of games.

10 (43m 17s):
They might keep him And I. I don't know. I just know he's dynamic and he, he, he, again, he's already, this was a fresh start. Yeah. He can be dynamic.

3 (43m 28s):
No, you know, he can be dynamic.

10 (43m 30s):
He, he's already getting a fresh start, obviously from, from being in New York. And, I would, I would love for him to see it work, you know, in Kansas City. And if it doesn't, sometimes you need more than one, one fresh start. And that, that, that's fine as well.

3 (43m 47s):
Yeah. I, but the question I always, I always, you ask yourself, man, I got this talented first round pick and a team was willing to move on the guy for one year. Like, damn. And then you gave, and then you trade him for what you traded him for. Yeah. I'm like, damn. So okay, so now I'm thinking, now I'm playing paying close attention Ocho, because something ain't, something ain't right now. Something ain't right. Hold on. After one year, a team gave up on a first round pick and you traded him for what you traded him for. And then, and he didn't help matters. Look bro, look, I And, I get it. Yeah. Because everybody deals with rejection differently.

3 (44m 28s):
I mean obviously it stung, bro. Right. What we just talking about Ocho? Yeah. I'm a first round pick and y'all moved on, so now I got gloat a little bit. But I think that, I think that's, that's what, that's what, that's what age. I think him being a little young probably handled that situation differently. But everybody handles situations different. You don't know what you do until you've been in that situation. I was in that situation. Denver didn't want me. We played them in the first round of the playoffs. We beat them. Right. Not only did we beat them, we went and won the Super Bowl. And I. Remember when we beat Denver, the, the, a reporter asked me, Shannon, you wanna call the National Guard on your former team?

3 (45m 8s):
Like, nah. Right. I said, I got a lot of good friends still over there. They hurting right now. This ain't the time, bro. This ain't the time. And I, remember seeing a lot of guys, they like Sha man, we happy for you. Hey man, go witness thing. But I mean, to each his own, some people are like, oh, you did this, you broke over me. I'm gonna get me a prettier girl or a guy with more money. Whatever the case may be. Ocho, everybody handle everybody can. We gotta stop that. And. I was a big proponent of that. This is what I would know. Unless you've been in that situation, you don't know because it'd been interesting. Had you won the Super Bowl, would would, you went back?

10 (45m 47s):
Yeah, I'm both like that. Never, never had, never would. But I

3 (45m 54s):
Oh, you, so what you doing to the db? You

10 (45m 56s):
Ain't celebrating on

3 (45m 57s):
About what you celebrating

10 (45m 59s):
Malicious now? I do, I do my little trash talking now. You know, throughout the week. Yeah. I do my trash talking on the, on the, on the field. Yeah. That ain't ain't nothing like, like at your head, at your head now, Steve Smith. Nah, now that's boasting. He going, he gonna talk. He gonna talk. Hey, Smitty don't play, boy. He gonna talk about you. Your mama ain ain't gonna talk about your kids. He gonna, he gonna, he gonna tussle with you. He gonna fight with you. He gonna swing, he gonna swing on you.

3 (46m 24s):
Literally.

10 (46m 27s):
Oh, man. Yeah, man, that

3 (46m 31s):
Smitty MA wild boy, man. Yeah, he a good dude, but ba but he better now. He better he, Hey, you know. Yeah. I had him on the pod, but he, he's in a better place now. Snap. But boy

10 (46m 41s):
A minute. Mind we was, we fair trick. We was at Santa Monica together. Remember now. So I was with Mty for two years, way back before we even made it.

3 (46m 47s):
Yeah. Allie Marin says Tom Brady offered cash incentives to teammates for one specific thing. He said Brady took a, a starting offensive, a lineman to the side. And he is like, Hey, if you guys can get a screen to go for more than 15 yards, I'll give you a thousand bucks cash each. That is for you guys. So every time that we get that, I'll be happy to make that payment. Marette said there were multiple plays that met the standard for the payment. Guys don't need millions of dollars to be incentivized.

10 (47m 18s):
They don't. That's dope.

3 (47m 19s):
They don't, we used to get money. A first one to the end

10 (47m 23s):
Comes Brady

3 (47m 27s):
20 bucks. They like, man, you making, Hey.

10 (47m 31s):
Yeah, yeah.

3 (47m 33s):
It's just a matter of pride. Ojo.

10 (47m 36s):
It's

3 (47m 36s):
The pride factor. I mean, hey, we have a great practice. Ooh, hat day, we won a game Victory. We got hat day Victory Monday. No, Monday, and we got hat day on Friday.

10 (47m 48s):
Oh yeah. And you know, it, it, it makes it fun. You, you are already rich and the fact that there's another added incentive, it's not much, you know, it's a thousand dollars, you know, for screenplays. It just makes the game that much more fun and wanting to accomplish it for your quarterback and for your teammates. For your teammates too. Something small. Just something small as that. How you excited and out there competing like hell

3 (48m 15s):
Man, Ocho, I remember we used to have Mike gave us that say, okay, every time we win a game, victory money hat, victory. Monday hat day on Friday, Man, we went damn near a year because we beat, hold on. Who we beat? We beat Seattle. No, no, no. Who was the last, right? No, we beat San Diego. There were Charger in San Diego back then. So we beat them. Won all the playoff games and the Super Bowl. Right. So we start next year with Hat day and Vic and Victory Monday and Hat Day, right. Won 13 straight. And then I remember we lost like, damn, what? Damn, I was more mad about, man, y'all done ed up my hat day.

3 (48m 57s):
Y'all done ed up Victory Monday, man, we 13 and old Joe. Man, we lose to the jail jet on a Saturday. And I'm like, all I'm thinking about, damn, we got to coming into this Rdy mofo on Monday. Right? And now we gotta wear helmets on Friday. That's the only thing I'm thinking about walking off the field. Not that we lost the game, not that we not gonna break the 72 Dolphins record. I'm thinking about having to take my black work on Monday. And I gotta wear a helmet on Friday. I ain't wore a helmet on Friday in a whole year.

10 (49m 33s):
Dang.

3 (49m 39s):
