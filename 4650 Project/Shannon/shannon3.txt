Oh, Joe, Tom also has some more critiques of the NFL. Let's take a, take a listen to what he had to say about this.

6 (3m 3s):
Offense is the only way to win games now. It used to be offense, defense, special teams. We've created a game now where only the offense can really make an impact. 'cause defense, every time you make a great defensive play, there's a penalty and it advances the ball 15 yards and they blame the defensive player for hitting an offensive player Too hard. Yeah. So I don't like those things. I'd like for it to, to to, to have a closer look at how we've affected the game in a negative way. And I think that should be, that should be seriously thought about for the future of the game.

7 (3m 33s):
He's right. We talk about it all the time. Allah, Kareem Jackson.

4 (3m 38s):
Yeah.

7 (3m 39s):
Playing in the game of football the way it's always been played. Again, the way it's affecting the game in a negative manner, but is it in a negative manner to the fans? What do the owners want? What does the NFL want? They want more scoring. Yeah. Like in baseball, we want more home home runs. So what do we do? How can we handicap the game so we can get more home runs? More viewership. Same thing with NFL chicks. Same

4 (4m 5s):
Thing went to the chicks. Dig Tom. Well who's that GL and Maddox that had that commercial chicks dig The long ball. What brought the back? Remember they went on strike?

7 (4m 15s):
Oh yeah, they

4 (4m 16s):
Went on strike. They they missed the whole, they shut the whole season down. World Series play out. We shut it down.

7 (4m 23s):
Everything. How

4 (4m 24s):
Do we get 'em back? The ball going over the fence. McGuire soso

7 (4m 29s):
Every, every time.

4 (4m 32s):
Okay, fans, what do fans like now? The purists will say, just like the baseball purists will say, we love a two one, we love a one nothing game. But the fans that's playing all that money to bring their kid they family of four that's costing them 3, 5, 6, a thousand dollars. Yeah. Nah, I wanna see a nine eight game. Damn, that one nothing game. Yeah, but that two one game that's boring. You

7 (4m 54s):
See them home runs

4 (4m 55s):
Fans. What do I wanna see? Ocho? I ain't trying to see no seven three. I ain't trying to see ten seven. I wanna see 35, 31. That what I wanna see. And I wanna seen the back over 400.

7 (5m 7s):
Yeah. Only one way to do that. Continue to put and implement rules to handicap the defenders where they can't actually play the game the way they've always played the game, the way they've been taught to play the game since they were little kids.

4 (5m 21s):
Yep.

7 (5m 21s):
It's unfortunate. It's unfortunate. So Tom is making sense.

4 (5m 26s):
Oh, Joe, I got a a, a letter. I was at this parents, remember I told you I was at this parents photograph signing and saw a couple of my old buddies that, that I played in the league with. And this guy, this colonel gave me this, gave me this letter. And I wanna read it? He says, thank you for so many years of providing entertainment to the world, the the callous hours on the field and behind the microphone will assist the morale of thousands and thousands of people that worked for me. We watch you on on Ees PN and also listen to the podcast and close as Colonel. He gave me his rank. Please show this. The o showed this to Chad Johnson and hopefully it will assist him in spelling Colonel all the best.

4 (6m 8s):
George, Georgie Elston, Georgie Elston, United States Army. He happens to be a colonel in the United States Army. So he said, oh, hey. He said, tell I love

7 (6m 19s):
You Colonel. Tell Colonel I know how to spell Colonel Matt.

4 (6m 22s):
We know how to spell it now, but

7 (6m 24s):
C-O-L-C-O-L-O-N-E-L. Okay. That

4 (6m 28s):
That what I'm talking about Ocho. Yeah.

7 (6m 29s):
You

4 (6m 29s):
Know, from time to time, Ocho, when you traveling people give you thing and it's always nice. They always mention Man, man, tell, tell Ocho man we love him. Tell Ocho man what you guys do on Nightcap. We watch, we watch Club Shehe a always, obviously the Kat Williams is, is brought up, but people really, really watch Nightcap and they'll appreciate what we do. And he's like, man, I don't know who put that together. I said, well, it's really not important who put it together. The fact of the matter is we are together. Whether, you know, whether, whether was, it was funny whether a prearranged oh joke, whether it was a pre-arranged marriage. It was a blind date. We weather the shopping mall. It doesn't matter at the end of the day. Yep. It's a beautiful marriage.

7 (7m 9s):
Yeah. It, listen, let me tell you our reach. And it ain't just the people that are our age. I went to visit, I went to visit my coach, Charles Collins, who's the head coach at Oak Christian School out in the valley today. Me and Chuck, me and Coach C he's responsible for my success as far as it comes to playing receiver and the tutelage that he gave me throughout the years. Man, I'm outta high school all the way out in the valley. I meet the kids first thing they say, well y'all funny on Nightcap. What? Tell uncle standing, Hey, you a freshman. What you, what you what doing Nightcap that time of night.

7 (7m 49s):
What you, you would think that they don't watch something like that. But the fact Unc the airport on the flight, everywhere I go, it's Nightcap what you and uncle doing. Right. It's fun. We so glad to see Unc actually be himself as opposed to what we see on tv. We never knew he had that side to

4 (8m 9s):
Yeah.

7 (8m 10s):
Yeah. This that's what, that's what I love about the show. That's what I love about what we're doing. 'cause we're allowed to be our true, authentic selves. And people always mention the chemistry. He say, man, y'all play off each other so well how long y'all knew each other? Y'all acting like y'all done know each other about 30, 40 years. I say we've known each other, you know, we cross paths every, you know, every so often. but it ain't like that's my brother I grew up with. Right. But we play it, it feel like we've been, we play off each other so well and the chemistry is so good. You would think we'd have knew each other. Close partners 10 for goddamn 30 something years. Yeah.

4 (8m 45s):
Yeah. It is. And it does, it does feel good to, to to know people that appreciate the stuff that you do. And it, it, it, it gives you a new light. Ocho. So anytime you receive some criticism, you know, for every one criticism you get, you got, yeah. You got a thousand people that love you. And that's so, that's so that's so refreshing to know that there's far more people that love what you do. Right. And how you do it than don't because there's always gonna be critic. They're gonna, like, there's something that you said or maybe you messed up a name because you know a lot of times, well, you said this name wrong or you said that. Well, I said I'm not, I'm sorry I'm not perfect. I mean today, today is all yours, Mr.

4 (9m 27s):
Perfect. I'm sure you perfect today. Nothing went wrong in your life. But hey, if that's the, if that's the the smallest thing how I look, what I dress like, if that's the only thing that you can find fault in me with.

7 (9m 40s):
Yeah. Oh, they gonna find some. I do it pretty good. They always find something. I do it pretty good. And you know, I, not, not too long ago I saw complaints about what we not talking about. So they done mood, the goalpost like, God damn, now you're mad. We not talking about certain things. Right. And now that's the issue we're

4 (9m 60s):
On for.

7 (10m 0s):
They gonna always find something. They talked about Jesus. They talked about Jesus sandals because they was a little too small. You didn't know that, huh?

4 (10m 8s):
Well, you didn didn't you, didn't you wash somebody feed with and with his hair?

7 (10m 13s):
What he, how you know you was there, you know Jesus turned water into wine.

4 (10m 19s):
Drink the wine right now.

7 (10m 23s):
That's a red solo cub.

4 (10m 26s):
That's

7 (10m 27s):
All right. What you got in now and what you got in now like that, that Laier

4 (10m 30s):
Water no died. The La Porter, you know, LA Porter, LA Porter have me all here but show we have no monetization tonight. I be every two hours. We'd just been too doing two hour rehearsal because I showed up. I'd have showed up old one tonight. Nah, I, I just, and that, and that's, that's what's so refreshing on show. 'cause like I said, a lot of times I meet people and they know, obviously they know who I am. I mean, be it football or now they saw me on, on on student or they saw me on on first Take now. But the man, they watch Nightcap in the club. Shahi. And I'm looking at the people And I, you know when they say don't judge a book by its cover. I'm like, dude. Oh yeah. I'm talking about people like white people, like 70 years old, 75 years old.

4 (11m 14s):
Yeah. Talking about they watch every, watching that and they watch the club shake shit. I'm like, huh.

7 (11m 19s):
But, but you, you have to understand we do something. There are a lot of podcasts. Yes. There are a lot of, there are a lot of

4 (11m 26s):
More to come

7 (11m 27s):
Outlets and platforms that talk sports. Unc the stories. Nobody can replicate or emulate the stories and the experiences that we've been through. No.

4 (11m 37s):
No.

7 (11m 38s):
Then there's a certain line that we touch. We, we don't really cross it. There's a certain line that we touch that other people can't. They can't go there. No. There are areas that we can go to, other people can't. And it's fun. It is exciting. It's unpredictable. You never know what we're gonna talk about. 'cause we don't even know half the time. No we don't.

4 (11m 59s):
Most the most of the time. Ash, like, do you wanna know? I say nah, just put it up on the screen. We'll, we'll talk about it. We'll talk about we'll get there. We'll get there. We what? I see it, what I see it pop up on the iPad. But that's it. I mean, Ocho, you know, look, you can't please everybody. Well, y'all didn't talk about this guys. We we're normally on here anywhere between two hours and two hours and 15 minutes. and we like to try to cover as much ground as we possibly can. Yeah. But we can't talk about everything that happened in the world. We can't talk about every sporting event. We can't talk about every football game, every basketball game. Then touch on ba then touch on baseball. Oh, what about golf?

4 (12m 40s):
Did you think the tiger would blah. You know, come on now.

7 (12m 44s):
Right.

4 (12m 45s):
But for some Ocho it's never gonna be enough.

7 (12m 48s):
No, no. But but it's gonna be enough of the ones that follow us. The ones,

4 (12m 51s):
It's gonna be enough for the ones they one

7 (12m 53s):
That love watching.

4 (12m 54s):
They're gonna, they're gonna appreciate it. Are we trying to expand our audience? Yes. That's why we try to touch on so many subjects. We understand that our, our our, our our core, we know what they like and we always try to make sure we incorporate some of that into a day of, you know, whether it's Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, whatever the case may be. We always try to incorporate something.

7 (13m 15s):
Matter of fact, you know what we can add to what now we want to, if we want to incorporate everything, we could also hold chapel.

4 (13m 23s):
No, we ain't gonna hold no chapel.

7 (13m 25s):
Don't wanna hold no

4 (13m 26s):
Chapel. That's why we got fellow se that's why we got fellow Cinco. We got Dunk on Unc. Those are, oh those are two our most popular sacks. Ojo.

7 (13m 34s):
Hey, hey. That goddamn spelling man, that if I hear one more person come up to me to about man why Unc? Why Unc be doing it like that? Man, I can't spell them words. Matter of fact, somebody was talk about when they hear you call a word to spell, they can't even put it right unless spell check. Give it to 'em the right way to look it up. I know, I think chapel might be good. 'cause then we could, we could bring in the Christians. We could been bring in the Catholic Catholic people.

4 (14m 3s):
You don't cus a hundred times before we get the chapel.

7 (14m 6s):
I ain't even, I ain't even curse today. You

4 (14m 8s):
Still got three or four of 'em in there?

7 (14m 10s):
No, no, no, no, no. I ain't curse today. I promise. 'cause I I said it in the chat before we even started the show. I promise I'm not gonna curse today. I've been, I've been praying on this and my therapist told me what I need to do to stop cursing. You know what I mean? You know I'm in therapy for that. Yeah.

4 (14m 23s):
Clearly ain't working. Change. Check this out. Don. Joe Stefon. Diggs likes tweets. Trashing bill's. Mafia bill's low key. Got far. Got the worst fan base. Y'all better as SF in the comments. What do you think? What do you think? How do, how do you think you, you, you like the way Stefon is handling this? Should just let it go. Just move on. You're in Houston now.

7 (14m 50s):
Have, have fun with it. Have fun with it. Because listen, I've seen people digs was not in control of him going to Houston. He was not in control Bill's. Mafia wasn't in control of it either. That was management's doing. That was management's doing. So he's not responsible for it. Now what I've seen, I've seen people from Bill's, Mafia, trash, Diggs. I've seen people from Bills, Mafia post pictures burning the 14 jersey, you know, things that Diggs gave you. All he had, he had some good years in Buffalo. There's no need players come and go. That's a the nature of the business. So when a player goes, what do fans always do? Ah, forget him. Glad to see him go.

7 (15m 30s):
It's always something negative. It's never Thank you for your services. Thank you for all you've done fuss on your time here. Never, ever, ever. It's always all the negative. Well, hell, when any player leaves your team, there will always be some negative thing to say. Yeah. Wait,

7 (18m 4s):
Amen. That's about a minute right there. Yeah. You know, I was, you know, I was an ordained minister back in 60. Yeah.

4 (18m 9s):
Yeah. I could tell.

7 (18m 11s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I

4 (18m 13s):
Tell you. Yeah. I

7 (18m 13s):
Could tell, I tell you. No lie. I could tell I could preach now, but I ain't gonna go there. 'cause it's not Sunday. It's not Sunday. Yeah. It's not Sunday. You know, Sunday, man, you know I was a young minister.

4 (18m 27s):
Yeah.

7 (18m 28s):
Ordained, but IIII tend to, I be, I used to curse in church and

4 (18m 32s):
Yeah, that

7 (18m 33s):
Ain't gonna work. You know, the people ain't the day of the day. They ain't, it ain't working like that. Yeah, I was, but you know, when I, when I give, when I give my message, yeah. God said, come as you are and speak it how you speak. And that's what I did. But the church ain't like that. So I, they, they, they threw me out. And. I just, I just gave up. Oh man.

4 (18m 53s):
Yeah. You know what, Ocho, look, this is how it seems to be a lot of times in a relationship you might have 5, 10, 15 great years have three bad months. It ends and somehow the three bad months replaces the 15, the 10, the five, everything

7 (19m 17s):
Actually done.

4 (19m 19s):
Me always. I've been in relationships. I can't let two months ruin 10 years. I can't let three, four months ruin seven years. I just can't.

7 (19m 33s):
Yeah. Oh, and you, you, you are a guy. Of course you can't. But ask a woman when things end, ask her remember the good things and see if she can remember 'em. But then ask her all the bad things that happened. I bet you remember every last one. Of course she could give you a dissertation on everything you did wrong, but you forgot about the other 10 that were great. And, I. And, and when it comes to relationships, if the good outweighs the bad, then I think you should stay. And if the bad, if the bad outweighs the good, we already know what you gotta do. Sometimes you gotta, sometimes you gotta be smart though. Yeah. You gotta be smart. Yeah.

4 (20m 11s):
I'm not gonna tell them me, I, I just, I like, there was no social media. I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't disappointed when the Ravens released me. I understood, I understood when they drafted Todd. Right. I understood why they you was at peace. Yeah. I, but I understood. I understood why they brought me there. I did the job they wanted me to do. Give the guys a, a some leadership, some guidance. Make plays, show guys what it takes to be, be a pro, a profe, a pro a professional. That's your occupation. A pro is who you are and how, how you go about your occupation. Right?

4 (20m 52s):
So no. And plus now Baltimore solidified Shannon, Sharpe for the rest of his life. If I didn't work those two years I was there. The amount of money that I made, I was good now. Right. Kids could go to school, gave college was all risk taken care of everything that I needed. I was good. I was at peace. And like I said, I met, I met friends. Like the relationship, I mean the relationship. I wouldn't trade that to have the relationship that I had with Ozzy, the relationship that I had with art mode, me, Woody Ray, the guys that I met, coach, I wouldn't trade that for anything.

4 (21m 34s):
Yeah. I wouldn't trade that for anything. Even when the, now I was a little bit more hurt with the Broncos that I didn't resign in 2000 because I'm like, okay, I broke my collarbone the fourth game of the season. Now mind you, I would, I had gone down with seven straight pro bowls. Four first team all pro in a five in a seven year span. And, I. Break my collar bone and you don't think I can play anymore. So you thought everything that I did was because of,

7 (22m 1s):
Alright. You know how they do you when you get hurt Now I, okay

4 (22m 6s):
Now I'm on a mid. I was all, I was all, so now,

7 (22m 11s):
Yeah,

4 (22m 12s):
Because I didn't play from what's the beginning of October. So now when the seasons end Ocho, I'm back at it because I wasn't able to do nothing. So now I'm, I'm back at it, man. Here I go. Ocho, I'm lifting all this weight. I'm lord have mercy

7 (22m 35s):
Just to get back. Right.

4 (22m 36s):
Go to OTAs. What I do Ocho tweak my hamstring. Come on man. Come on. Don't worry about it. Shannon. Brian says, Hey, don't worry about it. Be ready to come training camp.

7 (22m 54s):
Mm.

4 (22m 57s):
Well I tweaked my ham because I was running. 'cause you know they used to have the, the test and conditioning test where you run the treadmill. Yeah. They up it every like, every, every minute or so you go one point, you 0.5 or whatever it was. Man, I'm running on the treadmill. I'm thinking, man, I don't play football on the treadmill. I say Friday man, I ain't doing this here. He's like, you know, hey, I'm cool with it. Just go tell Brian, man, I got my ass off that treadmill and went straight upstairs. I say, Hey Brian, I don't play football on the treadmill. That condition test. I don't do nothing for me. Right. I took, I ain't do nothing else. I came back training camp, full metal jacket, Batman costume to up now.

7 (23m 44s):
Yeah,

4 (23m 45s):
Now you get an opportunity to see the real shake. It was hell Cutter. You know, that was the defense. You know that 2000 RA defense, you didn't play against it, but you heard about

7 (23m 54s):
10, 10, 10 points. 10 points a game. D Star. Wait, hold on. D Starks McAllister. Yeah.

4 (24m 0s):
Rod Woods. We had Red Rod and Sharper was the inside linebacker. Rob Burnett Goose, rest your soul. Sam Adams and Peter Ware. Oh,

7 (24m 12s):
Big Sam. Big Sam. The fastest First step M wait, mind you remember, I remember I saw that defense the following you man.

4 (24m 19s):
Yeah. It it wasn't the same. Yeah, I, I saw it. You know what Ocho only the 85 Bears got better from a defensive standpoint. If you go look at it, everybody talking about the 85 Bears because they won the super Bowl. But if you go back and look at it, the 86 Bears defense was actually better, statistically

7 (24m 38s):
Better

4 (24m 39s):
Than the 85 Bears. But normally defenses, like if you go back and look at the Legion of Boom 13 wasn't the same as 12. Right. And you go back and look at history with the exception of the Steelers. Now the Steelers, they were different.

7 (24m 55s):
Yeah.

4 (24m 56s):
When you got, and boy, when you got Hall of Famers, like you got two Hall of Famers and inside linebackers you got a Hall of Fame safety, you got a Hall of Fame quarter, you got a Hall of Fame dn. And you know, you got five Hall of Famers on offense with your quarterback. You running back, both your wide receivers, your center, your head coach is a hall of famer. Your owners are hell of Fame.

Complex Magazine ranks the best coaches in sports right now. Number one is the head coach of the University of South Carolina. Lady Gamecock. Don Staley. Andy Reids. I like number two. Dan Hurley is number three. Kirby Smart four. Gino Orma. Five. Borid six. Kurt, seven McVey. Bill Self, Kyle Shanahan, Kyle Shanahan, Jim Harbaugh, Becky Hammonds, Michael Boone, Dave Roberts and Mike Tomlin. Are you surprised by anybody? Let's just say in the top five, Don Staley is one. Andy Reeds two. Dan Hurley is three. Kirby Smart is four. Gino Orma is five.

7 (30m 32s):
No, I think the top five is good. I think the top five is actually good. I think some people obviously would probably personally change the order in which it is. But I like Don Staley being first based on what he's been able to accomplish. Obviously Andy Reed, his resume speaks Volume and what he's been able to do for the Chiefs in that organization with Patrick Mahomes at the helm. Mr. Hurley obviously

4 (30m 56s):
Back to back championship first time since 2006. Back to back Back. Yeah. Seven.

7 (30m 60s):
Back to back championships as well. But I mean, I don't, I don't see anything wrong with it. But again, if you, if you ask certain people, I think they will change purposely based on their preference. The order in which it in the order in which complex put it. But I like it what you

4 (31m 15s):
Think. I like it too. I like it. I love, I love Don Lv. Don DAWN Left. LV Don Andy. Yeah. I mean it's hard to argue Gino, his resume speaks for itself. 11 NCAs, right? 11 championships what? 23 final four appearances, right? Yeah. They got some great coaches on here.

7 (31m 37s):
I I have a question. Yes. Speaking of the coaches on here at number six. At number six, would Eric spo Eric SPO making it, would this be during the LeBron era?

4 (31m 45s):
No, I think the fact of the matter is that he's gone and it gone to the finals without LeBron.

7 (31m 50s):
Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Obviously

4 (31m 54s):
Steve Kerr, you know, hey, he's going to, he's going to five finals. He's won four. Sean McVay has won the super Bowl Bill s two time champ. Kyle Shanahan hasn't won any, but he is been to two.

7 (1h 13m 7s):
So you, you get

4 (1h 13m 8s):
A answer. Ask didn't ask. You didn't ask that. You said, who is the Jags all time leader in Sacks? Tony Brackens from the University of Texas.

7 (1h 13m 17s):
Right? Well, to complete the actual question, you would have to know the number of Sacks

4 (1h 13m 21s):
Had leader. No, I don't. That what you asked the leader, you said who you shoulda have said, who is the all time leader in sacks for the Jaguars? And how many sacks did he have? You can't add an addendum, which is an add-on. It

7 (1h 13m 33s):
Wasn't. No. So what you, what you did is, the question was, who was the all time leader in Sacks? So would, if you were very informative about it being Tony Brackens, you would also complete it to give the chat better context on how many sacks he has.

4 (1h 13m 47s):
Chat. Is Ocho trying to cheat me outta my win? He tried to cheat me outta my wing. I mean, you,

16 (1h 13m 50s):

4 (1h 16m 3s):
How long I could keep going. I might, what if I name all numbers? No,

7 (1h 16m 6s):
You cant because the question was, what if

4 (1h 16m 7s):
I name all the numbers

7 (1h 16m 8s):
To name at least three? No, I don't want you to name 11. You. I said name three. Oh my God. Now you named three and one of 'em was wrong. Hold up. Because Dick Bus, Dick Buckets was drafted in 1965. Not 64. Gail is correct?

4 (1h 16m 24s):
No, if I'm not mistaken, Gail and Jim Brown, Gail and Buckets came out in the same draft.

7 (1h 16m 31s):
Man, Dick Buckets was drafted in 1965. Gail says, was drafted in 1964,

4 (1h 16m 39s):
If I'm not mistaken. You

7 (1h 16m 40s):
Wanna argue? You wanna argue with me?

4 (1h 16m 46s):
Yes. They were both in the same draft buckets and sales was in the same draft.

7 (1h 16m 51s):
No, Dick Buckets was drafted in 65. Six four. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure where. I'm not sure where Ash should getting that information from.

4 (1h 16m 58s):
And, and Gail were in the same draft in 65. Now I'm wrong. About 64, but

7 (1h 17m 7s):
Drafted in 64.

4 (1h 17m 10s):
Ocho. Look, look at, if I'm not mistaken, look it up. Buckets was two in sales was four.

7 (1h 17m 16s):
Man, lemme

4 (1h 17m 17s):
Hook it up. Dick Buckets was drafted. Number two overall in 65. Ga three sales was four.

7 (1h 17m 26s):
Thank you.

4 (1h 17m 27s):
No, but they're in the same draft in 65. They came in together.

7 (1h 17m 32s):
Okay. You know what? But you got the answer wrong. Still. You, you got the answer wrong. Yeah.

4 (1h 17m 37s):

7 (1h 18m 4s):
Okay. Lemme, can I tell you something? Yes. We were talk about the 64 draft. So you arguing the fact and you still wrong? No,

4 (1h 18m 9s):
But I'm just saying they both came out in the same draft. Okay, go ahead. You got it. I'm wrong. I'm wrong one. I'm one for one.

7 (1h 18m 16s):
We got him chat number three, only two tight ends. All right, damnit, I know you gonna know this shit. I ain't gonna do it. Damn. Only two tight ends in NFL history have scored a hundred or more career touchdowns. Who are they?

4 (1h 18m 31s):
Oh, Tony Gonzalez and Antonio Gates.

7 (1h 18m 36s):
All right, man. That one. All right. We just, you know what? I gave you that one. No, no. Listen, listen. I know I gave you that one just so I can get this reaction outta you. I want you nice and confident for this next question so I can humble you. Number four, including the playoffs, which quarterback holds the record for the most rushing yards in one game?

4 (1h 18m 59s):
Colin Kaepernick against the Green Bay Packers. The computer, the computer. Now you might stop the computer once or twice, but the computer gonna go reset. Gonna get you

7 (1h 19m 22s):
Now you cheating over there, man. Okay. Okay. Guess the player chat. This is for y'all too. Guess don't cheat on your phones using Google. I am tied with Jim Kelly for the most playoff wins without a super Bowl win. I started my career in the late nineties. I played on three different teams

4 (1h 19m 47s):
In the late nineties. I

7 (1h 19m 48s):
Am tied with Jim Kelly for the most playoff wins without a super Bowl win. I started my career in the late nineties. I played on

4 (1h 19m 56s):
Three

7 (1h 19m 57s):
Teams, three different teams. Yeah, you ain't gonna get this one and the chat, the chat ain't gonna get it either. And don't, don't look at the chat for the answers too.

4 (1h 20m 6s):
Jim Kelly probably have somewhere around, I mean, he probably has around 12 wins because he went to four straight Super Bowls. I think they won a couple before then. So he who has 12 playoff wins.

4 (1h 20m 47s):
Is he in the Hall of Fame?

7 (1h 20m 51s):
I'm not giving you any more clues because if I tell you anything about him being in the Hall of Fame, it will make you answering the question that much easier. You can go ahead and say you don't know.

4 (1h 21m 1s):
Well, lemme think

7 (1h 21m 2s):
What happened to that computer you was talking about. I said,

NA Chad Chad. Don't be scared to ask because I'm gonna answer

4 (1h 24m 2s):
Bambino goodbye said, thank God y'all refuse to slander the r brother OJ Simpson. We depend on Unc Ocho to hold the culture down. Look, I mean, you can choose to believe he did it or he didn't do it. But still death is not a time to celebrate. Yeah. And, I, get it. You know, you, you supposed to cry when someone is born because they're born into this sinful world and you're supposed to rejoice, but not in the way they're rejoicing.

7 (1h 24m 38s):
Right. But some people are though. Of course. Yeah. Some people don't care. You, you have to understand how society is. Everybody's going to view it differently. They're going to look at his past, some of the things that he's done in the past, whether wrong or right. They're gonna hold that against him no matter what. So they're going to rejoice on someone's death. Now this, whether it, whether it's wrong or whether it's right, everyone's belief and opinions are gonna be different. Yes. Different. So it, it, it is something that you can argue come sundown to sunset. Yes. They gonna, it's it's people's preference. But I'm just saying for me, regardless of whether wrong or right, regardless of what happened, you don't celebrate nobody's death.

7 (1h 25m 20s):
Exactly. 'cause it's gonna come a calling for you as well. Someday,

4 (1h 25m 25s):
Joshua man said, oh, you just ign alienated your white audience because you defend a murderer. Jury admitted he did it on video. Put this show on BET. Dumb decision. This show isn't going anywhere. Joshua. You have a choice. You can choose to watch or you can choose not to watch. There was no defending oj My only thing was I don't celebrate someone dying. You can say he did it all you want to. That's not my, I don't get to form your opinion of your belief, but it what, tell me, how did I, how did I defend oj What did I say that made you think I was defending him or I was You didn't

7 (1h 26m 9s):
Say you didn't say anything. You didn't say

4 (1h 26m 13s):
Anything. 'cause I'm not celebrating because I'm not saying, oh yeah. Oh, Ocho, you know, he did it. You know, he got away. So because I didn't do that, I'm defending,

7 (1h 26m 25s):
They gonna twist the words. They gonna always move the goalposts.

4 (1h 26m 28s):
I tell you, they

7 (1h 26m 28s):
Hear what they want to hear.

4 (1h 26m 29s):
Oh, hey, if BET wanna put us on, we go on BET. But you don't get to determine where we go. The show is called Nightcap, Unc and Ocho. It don't say nothing about Joshua, Unc, Ocho and Joshua that don't say that. So you don't get to say, determine where we go. So Joshua, if you don't like the topic tonight, or what we said about a man, because you know, o j's family is mourning. They lost a father, they lost a grandfather, somebody possibly lost a brother. And obviously we've already empathized with the Brown Simpson family and, and the Goldman family.

4 (1h 27m 17s):
So you take it what you, what you want, and you go scurry on along. Okay?

7 (1h 27m 23s):

See I ain't, like I said, I ain't use the brush yet. I wouldn't, I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even think about putting that brush on somebody. I don't, I can't, there is not a woman that can make me dislike her enough because I know what that's capable of doing.

7 (1h 38m 10s):
Damn. And I know. It's funny, it's so funny. Like I I, I've been living with this for 40, 40, 46, 47 years. Right. And not having anything to help. I've tried, you know, pills at the gas station, you know, the rhino pill, And I try extends and, and everything has always been under three minutes.

7 (1h 38m 40s):
Yeah. No, she called me. She called me three and three, you know, three inches. 33 inches and three minutes. Yeah. So she be calling me 33 sometime. Like, well, damn. Like that's disrespectful to me. You know, I even looked into getting, you know, surgery and see if I could kind of enhance and, and keep the, the, the spice in relationship going on. 'cause I could only be funny so often. Yeah. That's why. Yeah. You know, I could only be funny so

4 (1h 38m 59s):

7 (1h 39m 5s):

4 (1h 39m 13s):
She stuck. She stuck.

7 (1h 39m 14s):
Yeah. Significantly. Because now, now you're stuck. See, you see what I mean? You see how I played that? Yeah. Yeah. You know, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry up. Get the baby out. You now you can't leave me because if you do now you're gonna be, you, you gonna be a single. You don't wanna be a single mama, do you? Huh? See, so I I I played that one real well. But I mean, there's, it is always been one of the things in my life where I've, I've always fell short and I'm not, I'm not ashamed to say that because we family chat, we family, and I'm letting you in on my personal life. And that's what, that's, that's what Nightcap is all about.

4 (1h 39m 42s):
So what would be your safe word?

7 (1h 39m 45s):
My safe word would probably be Giraffe. Yeah. Giraffe.

Red Rock. Red

4 (1h 39m 55s):

Didn't want hear it say

7 (1h 40m 1s):

Because you know they can't call you boy and Big Daddy. I hear that all the time. Oh, big daddy. Now you know, I, I gotta go long harder.

16 (1h 40m 17s):
Oh,

4 (1h 40m 22s):
Oh yeah. I, I picked up the Flex Cuff. I take the old Flex cuff out. I thought I was done with that stuff. You what? You know what I'm saying? You, I thought I was done with that. I, you know, I, John Wick, John Wick had got out the game. Yeah. You know, he had his stuff buried in the floor and when they killed his dog, he went out there and hit, went to the basement with the Chop. Brought his Yeah. Ocho. I got no stuff. I got put that stuff away. I put it away. Thought I was done with it, thought I was done with it.

7 (1h 40m 48s):
Damn.

4 (1h 40m 49s):
They be red out Ocho. You need to stop flying Spirit and, and come fly with me on American Airlines. I bet. Boy our Boeing seven 30 sevens are safe. Oh

7 (1h 40m 60s):
Hell no bless boy. and we can stop right there. He said Boeing 7 37. I done seen too many issues with seven 30 sevens. Regardless of what the fleet, regardless of who it is, whether it was American, whether it was Delta, whether it's United, the Boeings are having problems. The seven 30 sevens are having a problem. I love you. I appreciate you. I'm going to stay on Spirit. That has given me no issues and no problems. The fact that I am now an ambassador for Spirit and a consultant with Spirit. I appreciate the offer, but I'm gonna stay where I'm at. It's all love.

4 (1h 41m 32s):
He is a, they're safe. And plus your boy's a pretty good pilot. Pilot. So he's a pilot for American obviously. And he, he says, Hey, you'll be in great hand with him. Hey, Shannon and Ocho enjoyed the show. Question for you both. What changes are you willing to make or compromises to get prepared for marriage at this point in your life?

7 (1h 41m 54s):
Ooh. Well the funny thing about it is you don't compromise and sacrifice before the marriage. Yeah. The sacrifice and the compromise are already made before you get married. Yes. So once you transition and you've made that decision, decision, you get

4 (1h 42m 9s):
Prepared. So what compromise are you making to get prepared for marriage?

7 (1h 42m 14s):
Oh, I, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to share those compromises and those sacrifices here on this type of platform. Okay. Now I've already shared enough. I already let you inside my private life. I already let you in my bedroom. Now y'all just getting a little too little too nosy now. I'm just playing. I mean, I mean there, there, there, there are lots of them. Yeah, there are lots of them there. There's certain, there there's certain things. Listen, let all, alright, lemme stop playing. All jokes aside, there are certain things that you just can't do anymore. Yep. There's a name attached to mine. There's a name also attached to her. I have to be a representative of not just myself, but I also have to be a representative of that individual as the choices, the decisions I make. They don't just affect me, they affect that individual as well.

7 (1h 42m 57s):
Correct. I have to move different. Yeah, you do

4 (1h 42m 59s):
Absolutely have to be a

7 (1h 42m 60s):
Bit more

4 (1h 43m 0s):
Cautious.

7 (1h 43m 1s):
Absolutely. You know, I I I can't be as reckless as I used to, obviously when I was playing and it, it was reckless in a matter of not one that I can get in trouble. It was just my decision making. I gotta be a little bit more strategic, a little bit more methodical in some of the things that I do. And it just, it just, it comes with the territory. And that's something, especially at this age now, Unc, I'm not, I'm not getting no younger. Yeah. I ain't getting no younger. So it, it is that time for me,

4 (1h 43m 29s):
Patience would be my number one.

7 (1h 43m 31s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 43m 33s):
I'm not a great communicator. I'm really not. I need to get better at that. I'm definitely gonna have to prepare myself to get better for that. Because instead of me assuming someone knows when I'm not in the mood to talk, I need to tell 'em I need to a, I need a couple hours.

7 (1h 43m 50s):
Mm damn hours.

4 (1h 43m 51s):
I need a couple hours. I need a couple hours. Yeah. And in the process of taking a couple of hours, I'm gonna come back to you. Right. I just need some time to myself.

7 (1h 44m 4s):
Now, when you come back, are you going, are you going to finish the conversation with the issue was

4 (1h 44m 8s):
No, sometimes it's not even a conversation. Sometimes I just need time to myself. I don't even want to hear what you gotta say unless it's like, Hey Shannon, I I really gotta tell you this. But other than that Right. Gimme, gimme, gimme a couple hours to myself. But I'm here also understanding that now it is really all ours now. So what's mine is, so, you know, like for the most part, my brother and sister call, it's never know. My mom calls it never know.

4 (1h 44m 48s):
Right. Kids are like, hold on, what, what the, if you need this kind of money for and that and, and, and, and, and did you try to resolve the issue before you brought your ass to me? Because remember, I'm last resort, not first option.

7 (1h 45m 2s):
Right. Not the first option. Yes sir.

4 (1h 45m 4s):
And so, and so now I would have to be like, because I got somebody else, I've brought somebody else into the poll and we've decided that we've gonna be a union. And so now, hey, I gotta, hey, hey, hey babe. Look, because I don't ever want you to think that I'm still, you know, even though I'm making the money, you probably gonna sit down and take over the house. But that's your choice. If you want to continue to work, I don't wanna be a situation where I'm telling you I'm not doing something, but I'm secretly doing it anyway. Hey, my sister call, she need X, but dang your sister. Just, man, I've just got it. Like, because that, that was a big, that was always a problem in my relationships.

4 (1h 45m 46s):
Right. Well, your sister, I don't care if my sister called yesterday. If she called Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. That's my sister. Right. If my brother called, that's my brother. If my mom called, that's my mom. If my homeboys

7 (1h 46m 6s):
Right

4 (1h 46m 8s):
Now, I have to understand because like I said, when I, when I get with somebody, if your mom or your family needs something, I got them too. And so I don't, I don't want them to just like, oh, just because she with him and he got it. Right. Just to, just to wear out the welcome. So that's, that's gonna, that's gonna be the biggest issue because I'm just used to the, my money. I'm used to doing what the hell I want unabated.

7 (1h 46m 38s):
Right, right, right, right, right.

4 (1h 46m 40s):
Hey, hey, my brother called me, said, Hey bro, I need a quarter of a million. He ain't even gotta tell me what it's for. Right. He gonna have it tomorrow by noon. My sister say, Hey, my sister say, Hey Sheldon, I need, she ain't gonna never say she need that much, but hey, if she'll have it by noon, my homeboys call, they gonna have it by noon. So I have to be more like, okay, you, you're right babe. You're right. I just did said X amount of dollars. You're right. You're right. That's, that's gonna be, that's gonna be my, that's gonna be my biggest thing because for so long, Ocho, I've done what the hell I wanted with my money.

4 (1h 47m 22s):
Right. And so that's gonna be the thing. That's gonna be probably the biggest contention because I got a big heart when it comes to my family. Right. Because I'm like, I, that's my thing. I don't, I don't take vacations. So the money that I would've spent on vacations or getting a car or getting all this stuff, I got it. It goes to those in need. Yeah. So, yeah. And so I, I think that having someone to understand I need, I need like three, I need about three hours babe. And then I'm gonna come back to you. Okay. Can it wait, can can, can it wait or do I mean if it needs to, if it, and you know, I'm not used to like, can we, damn I say, can it wait, if it can't wait, let's go and handle it.

4 (1h 48m 7s):
Right. So that's gonna be the biggest thing for me, Ocho, because I've been kinda like, like doing things kind of my own way when it comes to like finances and when it, when it comes to like, you don't gimme time, I'll take it. So that's gonna be the thing. So that's something that I'm gonna need to work on and, and, and, and get better at because I'm, like I said, when it comes to my family, because when it was nobody but Sherra, Sterling and Shannon, when that was all I had. Right. And Don don't even have to, I don't even have to question my brother.

4 (1h 48m 50s):
'cause I know when he had And, I didn't, I got it. Hey bro. Yeah. Hey man, check this out. Black college beach week, man, I need the whip. Hey, come get it bro. You know, Hey man, money jumped funny here. Here's five grand. You know, he, he gonna make sure I have my sister. Right. I always, it, she was never, you know, my sister never had no money, but if we needed it, she gave us what she had or she go get it from her boyfriend to give it to us. So yeah. My, my my my my brother and sister can get it. My homeboys, they know. But even when it comes to my homeboys Ocho, I'll never, I, I don't lend my homeboys money.

4 (1h 49m 32s):
I give them money, but, but I'll never give them a sum that I'm gonna miss. Never. So whatever it may be, it might be 10, it might be 50. If I think I'm gonna miss it, I, I can't do it. Right. But my homeboys has never paid me back in 30 years. I've never asked for it. I'll never ask for it. So that's what I'm gonna have to be. 'cause I know like, 'cause it's hard. Like, I like if it's your mom, your mom in a situation, your daddy needs something, hey, take off with it. Yeah. Now you start talking about your brothers and your sisters.

4 (1h 50m 14s):
I, whatever. Well, you gave it to your brother and your son. Like, damn, you, you right though. I said, but when I said that I kind of met your mom, you know, I'm kind of meant like your mom or your dad, but you know, hey. Right. That's, that's, that's how I am Ocho. So I just, I've gotta be better at that because, you know, even, even my kids, you know, I'm like, because I try to teach them, you know, kind of like, okay guys, come on now. Y'all need to, and don't be reckless with the money. You know, Hey, what's it for? Because if I find out you, you know, jerking my money off, now I'm, I'm gonna feel some type of way. Wait. Yeah. But for the most part, they've been, they they've been good when they need something.

4 (1h 50m 60s):
But that's, that's gonna be the hardest thing. Ocho, that's gonna be the hardest thing. 'cause I've kind of been, did what I wanted to do. You know, my mom called me, like, she go, she wanted to go to Vegas. Okay. Hey Shelly, put on a plane to Vegas. Hey she, I need some money. Okay. Shannon, I ran outta money. Shelly send her some money. I gotta like, okay, you know, hey, somebody, you know, somebody else send no money. You know, And don don't wanna go. I don't want to, I don't wanna be sneaky with it either. If I tell I'm, if I tell her I'm not gonna do something, I gotta hold to that. Even though like, damn, they used to me for 35 years. Anytime they call, they got it.

4 (1h 51m 41s):
You got it. Yeah. But I think we might have to put some stipulations. Look, but brother and sister man, they call, Hey, I'm sorry I, you know, Adrian said, can we get some Nightcap merch coming. I got a big crush on Unc with Love and Mug, with Unc and Ocho facial expressions on, say, same for La Porter. We need some glass sets that's coming. Also, Patrick Rendon Rendon said, Hey guys, my dog passed away yesterday. It didn't hit me that he was gone until I got home, and there was nobody waiting for me at the front door. What's the thing that you, when you losing a dog, bro, telling you it's sad, bro, it is like losing a family member. And, and, and, and they studied it.

4 (1h 52m 23s):
It says, when people lose a pet, it's, they related to like losing a family member because it's, don't you? I mean, you don had that. Yeah. Yeah. That, that pet has been in your life. Notice what they said, pet, it's been in your life 5, 6, 7 years, every single day. No matter how sad you are, man, it's happy to see you.

7 (1h 52m 47s):
You every time, every time. And I told you, And I would never, I would never experience that pain ever again. Here you had me goddamn crying. When we, when you told me about your I'm, you got me boohooing a little bit. Yeah, man. Just you talking about your dog and like, I, I just, that ain't even my animal. So if I'm crying about you losing your dog in hand, you talk about it, you already know. But I'm not dealing with that pain no more. No sir. No sir.

4 (1h 53m 15s):
Drew said, don't you have a photo of you and my lay father? How do you, how do you go about sending it? How do I go about sending it to you to get it signed?

You, like pa Yeah. You like, you like, you like Pablo Escobar with the La Portier, huh?

So they're like,

Bring that thing on the plane.

This is greatly gonna diminish. I, I said, I don't give a damn about no profits. Y'all done put me, y'all done put it on the line. These people spend their hard-earned money and we said we was gonna deliver it in a timely fashion. So I'll forego my share, forget my share, get the people, the cognac. And so we're actually by, by

Any means, be any means

Necessary. I don't, I don't give you, if you gotta find, if you gotta find a David Copperfield and he magic, and he could appear over there and and bring two cases back at a time. Right? Get it done. And so that's what we're doing. Yes, we still have the Freightliner, the aligners that's coming, but right now we're, we're actually air shipping. So we're sending planes over there to bring it back at double the cost. But that's what, that's what we have to do. That's what we're gonna do. And so guys, thank you.

So should we go electric? I

19 (1h 57m 34s):
Think we should go electrified with Toyota.

18 (1h 57m 37s):
Electrified.

19 (1h 57m 37s):
Electrified means options. Yes, we could go all electric with a Toyota BZ four X, but then there are hybrids like Grand Highlander. Or we could do something in between like a RAV4 plugin hybrid.

18 (1h 57m 46s):
So Toyota is electrified, diversified.

Yep. And with more options for reducing carbon emissions, the closer we all get to Toyota's beyond zero vision for the future. Exactly.
